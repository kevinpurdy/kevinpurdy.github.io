The people we now call Vikings measured their years, their ages, in winters, 
not years. Winters in the Netherlands, before 1000 A.D., were pretty brutal.  
Winters were something you survived; they were a mark of distinction.

Winters aren't much nicer in upstate New York. Moreso, some of the most brutal 
realities of what happened last year are yet to pass. This review, then, is not 
a full telling of This Winter, but it captures all the warm months.  Future 
archaeologists, take note.  

Also, archaeologists: Are you still forced to fill out Captchas? I bet not. I 
hope you appreciate that little grace. Anyways.

### Working for the New York Times

The Paper of Record[^1] purchased the company I joined in 2015. The company is 
technically Submarine Leisure Club, which was always fun to explain to loan 
officers and TSA Pre agents. Submarine Leisure Club was the company started by 
Brian Lam to launch [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com) and [The 
Sweethome](http://thesweethome.com). They bought us because they respect our 
work, and they are interested in our revenue model (affiliate revenue, with 
full disclosure and editorial integrity).

If those previous two links don't work when you read this, we're probably fully 
integrated into the Times now. Or the web is broken. That's not as far-fetched 
as it sounds, once you've seen what holds the web (or the country) together.  
Ahem.

So far, not much about my actual job has changed. I still use things, assesss 
things, argue about how I used and assessed those things, and fill spreadsheets 
with rows of product details and notes that seem lightly unhinged. But if I 
step back, I'm working for the New York Times, and this is something that makes 
me very proud. It would have made my old man proud, no doubt. 

When I was a young reporter, every time I would visit home on a holiday, my dad 
would ask me, "Why don't you send your articles to the New York Times?" I used 
to think, like all children, that my dad just didn't _understand how it works 
now_. But now I think: You know, he read the _Times_ every Sunday (before it 
went up to $6), he lived in this world, he knew what big cities and big 
corporations looked like. Maybe it wasn't _naïveté_ about careers. Maybe he 
just knew that none of us are going to live as long as we like, that people get 
hired for all kinds of dumb coincidences, and it's not worth living with regret 
that you didn't take the shot you wanted to take.

I did get a pretty cool tote bag, and I get a free digital subscription, which 
is neat. And the support and backing of a company that is trying to inform 
people of what's going on in their world, however much of it they're willing to 
I take.

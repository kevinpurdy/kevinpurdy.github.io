The people we now call Vikings measured their years, their ages, in winters,
not years. Winters in the Netherlands, before 1000 A.D., were brutal.  
Winters were something you survived; they were a mark of distinction.

Winters aren't much nicer in upstate New York. It's also true that some of the most brutal
realities of what happened last year are yet to pass. This review, then, is not
a full telling of This Winter, but it captures all the warm months.  Future
archaeologists, take note.

Also, archaeologists: Are you still forced to fill out Captchas? I bet not. I
hope you appreciate that little grace. Anyways.

### Working for the New York Times

The Paper of Record[^1] purchased the company I joined in 2015. The company is
technically Submarine Leisure Club, which was always fun to explain to loan
officers and TSA Pre agents. Submarine Leisure Club was the company started by
Brian Lam to launch [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com) and [The
Sweethome](http://thesweethome.com). They bought us because they respect our
work, and they are interested in our revenue model (affiliate revenue, with
full disclosure and editorial integrity).

If those previous two links don't work when you read this, we're probably fully
integrated into the Times now. Or the web is broken. That's not as far-fetched
as it sounds, once you've seen what holds the web (or the country) together.  
Ahem.

So far, not much about my actual job has changed. I still use things, assess
things, argue about how I used and assessed those things, and fill spreadsheets
with rows of product details and notes that seem lightly unhinged. But if I
step back, I'm working for the New York Times, and this is something that makes
me very proud. It would have made my old man proud, no doubt.

When I was a young reporter, every time I would visit home on a holiday, my dad
would ask me, "Why don't you send your articles to the New York Times?" I used
to think, like all children, that my dad just didn't _understand how it works
now_. But now I think: You know, he read the _Times_ every Sunday (before it
went up to $6), he lived in this world, he knew what big cities and big
corporations looked like. Maybe it wasn't _naïveté_ about careers. Maybe he
just knew that none of us are going to live as long as we like, that people get
hired for all kinds of dumb coincidences, and it's not worth living with regret
that you didn't take the shot you wanted to take.

I did get a pretty cool tote bag, and I get a free digital subscription, which
is neat. And the support and backing of a company that is trying to inform
people of what's going on in their world, however much of it they're willing to take.

### Writing

For the first year in memory, I only wrote for my employer, and a few times on this site. No freelance writing to speak of. Easy taxes, for certain, but not certain how it sits with me.

What I wrote here:

+ [2015 In Review](http://thepurdman.com/2015-in-review/)
+ [Make the HP Stream 11 into a Linux Crapbook](http://thepurdman.com/install-galliumos-linux-on-hp-stream-11/) (I mostly wrote this post on that Crapbook! Hooray.)
+ [Lait Cru Brasserie on a Friday night](http://thepurdman.com/post-about-food/)

### CoworkBuffalo acquired a software service

2016 was the third year of CoworkBuffalo at its current Main Street location, and the fourth-and-a-half-th year of operation period. Five co-owners, dozens of members and visitors, and a decent number of poeple who drop in while they're staying with family, visiting town, or launching their thing. It's my most low-level work, and easy to forget how weird/wonderful it is to be part of a business in downtown Buffalo.

We use [Desktime](http://desktimeapp.com) to manage booking, payments, and subscriptions at CoworkBuffalo. It's the best kind of software, because it's just enough, and not too much. We have tried other services, and they are (how does one say in French?) _a waking nightmare of checkboxes and upsells_. We learned from the maker of Desktime that he was looking to focus on a new venture, [Deskpass](http://deskpass.com). We talked it over, looked at the code and financials and customer situation, and decided we could make a home for it.

Desktime is going to become [Mx. Desk](http://mxdesk.com) pretty soon. [I wrote a post about the naming process on the Mx. Desk Medium](https://medium.com/mx-desk/how-we-came-up-with-the-name-for-mx-desk-36a0d0b974cf). In the meantime, [Nick Q](http://twitter.com/qrush) has made the code faster, more stable, more secure, and easier to watch and manage. I've written some words and answered as many support tickets as I can. It's going ... eerily, quietly well. If you have any interest in using or partnering with Mx. Desk, you
should [give us a shout](mailto:hello@mxdesk.com).

### TEDxBuffalo

This year's TEDxBuffalo felt like the most professional event yet, one that truly spoke to the effort that everyone involved puts into this weird thing. [All of the talks spoke to me](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsRNoUx8w3rO8QwWGAI84PTE9h6soHIXz)
, and a few of them felt like they were speaking directly to me. A lot of new volunteers took part in this event, and I think they are the future of this thing. I'm handing over the license to this thing this year, after six years of holding it, and I feel pretty great about it.

<a name="lifting"></a>

### Lifting

I [busted my knee in 2015](http://thepurdman.com/2015-in-review/#knee) and had surgery in January 2016. I kept running a bit, but nowhere near as much as before. I did a couple 5Ks, a bit of interval training, but on borrowed knee time. I needed something else. Something to counteract all the terrible eating and drinking I do. Something where I can see the numbers move in the right direction.

I spent a bit more time learning how my (1984) road bike worked, and rode it around town whenever I could. But long-distance cycling didn't hold much appeal: Expensive, rarefied, requires a lot of gear to tote around. I still hit a spinning class once a week, but too much more and my knee acts up, or I start hearing Lana Del Rey remixes when I'm walking around. Swimming would require I learn how to actually Swim-swim in a lane. And it's not my favorite thing, being underwater. Anything involving coordination with a puck or a ball or the like, and having to coordinate with other people to do it, was generally out of the question.

I wanrted something I could do at home, or wherever I happened to be, like running.  So I started out with an Android app, [100 Pushups](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=alexcrusher.just6weeks.pushups). Then I started tagging along with my wife to her mixed-martial-arts-style training class. Next was pull-ups, and then crunches. I felt better, like I had felt when I was training for a big run. Then, despite a lot of negative experiences in high school, I thought to try lifting weights.

I didn't even know what to call the thing I wanted to do, but I quickly discovered that it was _not_ bodybuilding―oh, God, [those forums](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=107926751&pagenumber=1). One of my coworkers writes a column for The Hairpin, [Ask A Swole Woman](https://thehairpin.com/ask-a-swole-woman-getting-started-36849181c388). It's hard to understate how useful something is that's _not_ written with a shitty attitude about health and _not_ pitched toward spending money on things. I somehow came across [Scooby's Workshop](http://scoobysworkshop.com/), which, yeah, it's a dude with an odd voice and who's shirtless all the damned time while talking to a camera, but it's also really sensible about what you can expect and how to get going. I landed on doing a [StrongLifts 5x5 program](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/), with regular check-ins with a trainer and [Mark Rippetoe's _Starting Strength_](http://startingstrength.com/) to make sure I'm not endangering my back.

You might say strength training is simple: Lift heavy things, a bit heavier than the last time, then take a day off. But you only get to say that if you're lucky enough to have never been injured, or just too young to care about your long-term health, or your back. Your body will do all sorts of things to cope with a relatively heavy weight, and some of those things are really stupid things to do unless you're trapped under a boulder. Right now, I'm still recovering from something I did wrong during a bench press. Bench press _seems_ like a simple exercise, unless something in your grip causes an imbalance, and then _ruh-roh_. All I can do is wait and try to be better next time. I'm good with that.

### One year of Twitter

I posted TK tweets in 2016, breaking the most important rule of Twitter over and over again. Most were dross. A few seemed to make people smile, or think, or something like that.

### In Pod Form

[Phil Dzikiy](http://twitter.com/phildzikiy) and I recorded six episodes of [In Pod Form](http://inpodform.com), a podcast that is indeed two white dudes talkin', last year, our first new episodes since early 2014. It is an excuse I need to talk to a friend who now lives far away. I'm not doing a very good job of being game for a new episode, but I intend to get to it soon.

### "Video" games

On PC, on my phone, and, just for the week between Christmas and New Year's, on XBOX 360, I played these games in 2016:

+ The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (_I have a lot to say about this game, so don't ask me at a bar if you don't want the firehose._)
+ XCOM: Enemy Unknown (_The older one, on sale when the sequel arrived. Really good._)
+ Fallout 4 (_Released in late 2015, but, yeah, definitely some 2016 in there_)
+ Hitman: Absolution (_Solid B or B- Hitman, which is still better than doing taxes_)
+ Bioshock Infinite (_Please don't ask me about this one if I've been drinking_)
+ Dishonored (_This was pretty cool_)
+ Wasteland 2: Director's Cut (_I fell off this one when I reached a "Where next?" moment, as often happens with RPGs. It's on my Steam Guilt List_.)

<a name="president"></a>

### The next president

Maybe this is reflective of how much I think about my own health lately. Or maybe I'm just simple-minded. But I agree with Jay Rosen that our incoming president [is not a "master of media,"" he just has an absolute lack of shame](https://twitter.com/i/moments/819786803221626881). My example is pretty base, but I have to record it here, because one day I might forget what this time was like. The time when we had to deal with a user who exploited all of the bugs in our system at once.

The incoming president had his doctor [write a letter in five minutes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/27/the-strange-tale-of-donald-trumps-doctor-letter-just-got-stranger/?utm_term=.ca1e5d7b63cd) declaring that his patient would be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."

This guy.

![Donald Trump during his Dr. Oz ... whatever that was](/assets/post_images/2017-01-17/trump_golf_cart.jpg)

Healthier than everyone, including this guy.

![Barack Obama playing golf](/assets/post_images/2017-01-17/obama_golf.jpg)

We even have the two side by side. Quick: pick one for your relay team.

![These are two men who were and will be president](/assets/post_images/2017-01-17/sidebyside.jpg)

Remember when George W. Bush took some standard flack for having bruises and scrapes [after a mountain-biking accident](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/george-w-bush-recovers-from-bicycle-accident)?

You and I, dear reader, both know we are not the healthiest people ever to do anything. We know our bodies. We have failures, moments, wishes, and pains we can't forget. And we don't say that about ourselves because we know that, if someone were to question us or admonish us for saying this later, we would feel lesser in their eyes. Were word of our actions to spread further, we might even feel lesser in our community. Neither you nor I would think, "At least they're talking about me!"

I'm not going to finish that thought, because you're smart enough to get it. This example helps me. I haven't "figured it out," but it feels like a pinhole through which I might view the sun.

### All you can do

If 2015 was the year of the [2/5 Life Crisis](http://thepurdman.com/2015-in-review/#two-fifths), then 2016 was ... another year of dealing with it. Specifically, this part, again, and again:

> The fearful, reactive part of my brain was telling me, constantly, that I was not a Good Writer, based on the edits and notes I would get back (even though everybody gets edits and notes). That would be okay if I was a Serious Journalist, but I wasnât that, either, because I couldnât get started on this article Iâd had in my head for years. I was not a Good Homeowner, because, God, just look at my old house getting older, and imagine what my neighbors think of me. I was not a Fast Runner, a Responsible Money-Saver, a Decent Parent, a Social Work Hero.

First, let this be a learning moment, for you and for me: Just because someone writes a blog post about something, does not mean they have worked through it. Oh, mercy, no.

One day in autumn of last year, I was riding a positive mental wave. I told my therapist that I had come to terms with my place in the world. I said that I understood that the world, the universe, are so vast that there is no way everybody can be perfectly acknowledged and fulfilled, even for 15 minutes, even for .025 seconds. Whatever I thought I should be doing, whatever I thought was fair, it didn't matter. All you can do is work on what's in front of you, and sometimes step back and consider what it's building toward. For some people, there's no time for that last part, and it would be good to be grateful for it.

One day last week, I was unbalanced by work and lots of negative thought. I loaded up a 5-minute guided meditation on my phone. I went into a phone-call room at my coworking space. I listened to a man with a British accent speak in my headphones. He walked me through deep breaths and centering thought. The man asked me to think about myself as a child, and to think about what that child wanted to be when he grew up. I fought very, very hard to not cry in a four-foot-square room. Not sure I succeeded. So much for building toward something.

The only thing that makes sense for me, in this place, at this moment―is that I'm hung up on trying to build a "body of work." I spend a great deal of effort trying to build Things. Work product, serious articles, little businesses, events, networks, even parts of my home. But all of these things will cease to exist. Before they cease to exist, they will cease to matter to hardly anyone.[^2]

What will matter, and what will quietly outlast those Things, are actions. Who you are, and what you're capable of, for other people and for yourself, are your long-term project. I have to try to remember that every day is building something, even if I don't want to believe it. When the sun dies out, and everything we've done on Earth starts to freeze and crumble, this post won't matter, nor will anything I wrote or coded. On the cosmic balance sheet, it has to matter more that I helped other people when I could, was honest at many moments, walked my dog, had lunches with old friends, called my mom.

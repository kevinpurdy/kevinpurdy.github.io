## Games

2021 was the year of [roguelike deck builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike_deck-building_game) and Western RPGs.

### PC

#### Hitman 3

#### Divinity: Original Sin 2

#### Disco Elysium

#### Prey

#### Control

#### Monster Train

#### Roguebook

#### Wildermyth

### Switch

#### [Griftlands](https://klei.com/games/griftlands)

Developer Klei entertainment gets right of first refusal in my library. I loved _Don't Starve_ and _Invisible Inc_. This one is (surprise!) a roguelike deckbuilder, set on a dystopian-ish colony planet. It's a great airport/free-moment Switch game. You can negotiate or fight your way out of every situation, and there are real pay-offs to choices you make, positive and negative.

### iOS

#### Overboard

## Ugh, Twitter

For no monetary gain and almost no reward, I continued feeding Twitter's API in 2021. Here are five selected tweets, with the most-ish likes/faves/whatevers, minus work stuff.

<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy/status/1455724441128906752">![Another Buffalo Was Possible](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/tweet1.jpg)</a>

(Previous tweet is re: [this](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/another-buffalo-is-possible) and then [that](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/buffalo-election-2021-results-india-walton-defeated.html))

<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy/status/1382858994029621260">![I attended a memorial, ride, and rally for bike safety in DC, in honor of Jim Pagels, killed at Mass Ave./2nd St. NW. Friends remembered Jim, we rode to city hall, we laid down our bikes at city hall. Citizens should not die on wide roads so that people can commute faster.](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/tweet3.jpg)</a>

<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy/status/1385242418560258049">![Been working at @iFixit > 2 years. Ever since, I dread Earth Day. Companies, celebrities, media going out of their way to say literally anything except "consume less." Causing less material from the earth to be manufactured is actual help. But most people can't or won't say it.](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/tweet5.jpg)

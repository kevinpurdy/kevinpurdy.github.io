## One full year in DC

## The Buffalo Bills

I traveled to Nashville to gather with Buffalo friends, hanging the trip on seeing the Buffalo Bills play the Tennessee Titans. It was a tighter game than most expected, and the game essentially came down to the Bills' quarterback Josh Allen slipping on the last play. Walking back from the stadium, my friend [Ryan](https://www.patreon.com/thegoosesroost/posts) said he was willfully refusing to be too mad about it. The team, and especially Josh Allen, were promising, he said. This was not one of those games from [The Drought](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bills-playoff-berth-snaps-longest-postseason-drought-in-pro-american-sports/) (and [he should know](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428220940/http://www.thegoosesroost.com/2017/01/introducing-the-droughtcast/)).

It was the start of a mid-season rough patch. They regained their form, though, and made the playoffs. I started feeling [the excitement again](https://thepurdman.com/2020-in-review/#bills). Hats and sweaters came out. Then my friend Ryan was proved correct, twice in two weeks.

The 47-17 win over the Patriots was both [the first-ever perfect offensive game in (modern) NFL history](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/bills-played-first-perfect-offensive-game-in-nfl-history-in-win-over-patriots/ar-AASPXcs) and an exorcism of the Patriots' 20-year hex on the Bills, a hex cast primarily by Tom Brady. I was at home, yelling, hooting, anxiously awaiting something to break the streak, but nothing did. An real [changing of the guard](https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2022/01/16/patriots-bills-review-chad-finn/), with lots of ceremony.

The next game the Bills did not win. The consolation prize: it was arguably the [most exciting NFL game](https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/chiefs-bills-2022-nfl-playoffs-wow.html) of [all time](https://defector.com/that-was-a-football-game-for-all-time/). It was the best one I've ever seen. I watched it at a DC bar taken over by the local Bills backers. I screamed at every unlikely touchdown catch, called out the response to the [Shout Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpeDWbgUO8), hugged people I didn't know when it seemed like we'd clinched it.[^1]

I don't get to see the Bills in the Super Bowl. Instead, I get to see the Bills win the sports world's respect—statistically undeniable, historically significant respect. No small thing, that. Next year.

## Repairs

The biggest "fix" I made in 2021 was to my 2013 car. I wrote about [replacing my awful Ford Sync system](https://www.ifixit.com/News/52123/the-coming-battle-over-hacking-your-own-car) (and learning a lot about car wiring) at iFixit.

## Games

2021 was the year of [roguelike deck builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike_deck-building_game) and Western RPGs.

### PC

#### Hitman 3

#### Divinity: Original Sin 2

#### Disco Elysium

#### Prey

#### Control

#### Monster Train

#### Roguebook

#### Wildermyth

### Switch

#### [Griftlands](https://klei.com/games/griftlands)

Developer Klei entertainment gets right of first refusal in my library. I loved _Don't Starve_ and _Invisible Inc_. This one is (surprise!) a roguelike deckbuilder, set on a dystopian-ish colony planet. It's a great airport/free-moment Switch game. You can negotiate or fight your way out of every situation, and there are real pay-offs to choices you make, positive and negative.

## Ugh, Twitter

For no monetary gain and almost no reward, I continued feeding Twitter's API in 2021. Here are five selected tweets, with the most-ish likes/faves/whatevers, minus work stuff.

## One full year in D.C.

I know more of the neighborhoods. I've taken some Metro subway rides. If someone asked me where to eat or drink or just walk near my home quadrant, I have quite a few suggestions. I've lived through a full summer here, and now one of the coldest winters in a couple decades. I'm approaching the point where I can say "I live in D.C." out loud and don't immediately question the statement in my head.

The hardest part is making friends. I'm 41, I'm new here, I work from home for a company somewhere else, there's a pandemic, and D.C. is a city where a lot of people are on their way up or out. I'm lucky to have the Buffalo connections I do have, while they're still here. But it's like jobs and experience: the best way to make friends is to have friends, who introduce you to others.

The advice I read and hear most often is to join groups based on my interests, and to be a lot more deliberate in telling people what you're after—friends. I can certainly do better. But D.C. is not like Buffalo, where showing up and showing interest carry you much further. Is this a fair comparison? I've applied to the D.C. versions of three things I was involved with in Buffalo. Two of them have not responded to a couple different emails/applications. One of them is just far enough away by bike or by Metro[^2] that it's easy to get discouraged by an out-of-date website, an unreturned email.

But I like it here. I'll try harder.

## The Buffalo Bills

<img src="/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/bills.jpg" alt="Bills Little People with chicken wing hat, placed underneath Go For It pennant" class="right"/>

I traveled to Nashville to gather with Buffalo friends, hanging the trip on seeing the Buffalo Bills play the Tennessee Titans. It was a tighter game than most expected, and the game essentially came down to the Bills' quarterback Josh Allen slipping on the last play. Walking back from the stadium, my friend [Ryan](https://www.patreon.com/thegoosesroost/posts) said he was willfully refusing to be too mad about it. The team, and especially Josh Allen, were promising, he said. This was not one of those games from [The Drought](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bills-playoff-berth-snaps-longest-postseason-drought-in-pro-american-sports/) (and [he should know](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428220940/http://www.thegoosesroost.com/2017/01/introducing-the-droughtcast/)).

It was the start of a mid-season rough patch. They regained their form, though, and made the playoffs. I started feeling [the excitement again](https://thepurdman.com/2020-in-review/#bills). Hats and sweaters came out. Then my friend Ryan was proved correct, twice in two weeks.

The 47-17 win over the Patriots was both [the first-ever perfect offensive game in (modern) NFL history](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/bills-played-first-perfect-offensive-game-in-nfl-history-in-win-over-patriots/ar-AASPXcs) and an exorcism of the Patriots' 20-year hex on the Bills, a hex cast primarily by Tom Brady. I was at home, yelling, hooting, anxiously awaiting something to break the streak, but nothing did. An real [changing of the guard](https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2022/01/16/patriots-bills-review-chad-finn/), with lots of ceremony.

The next game the Bills did not win. The consolation prize: it was arguably the [most exciting NFL game](https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/chiefs-bills-2022-nfl-playoffs-wow.html) of [all time](https://defector.com/that-was-a-football-game-for-all-time/). It was the best one I've ever seen. I watched it at a DC bar taken over by the local Bills backers. I screamed at every unlikely touchdown catch, called out the response to the [Shout Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpeDWbgUO8), hugged people I didn't know when it seemed like we'd clinched it.[^1]

I don't get to see the Bills in the Super Bowl. Instead, I get to see the Bills win the sports world's respect—statistically undeniable, historically significant respect. No small thing, that. Next year.

## Repairs

![Car dashboard with top part opened up to reveal display system's guts](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/sync_swap.jpg)

The biggest "fix" I made in 2021 was to my 2013 car. I wrote about [replacing my awful Ford Sync system](https://www.ifixit.com/News/52123/the-coming-battle-over-hacking-your-own-car) (and learning a lot about car wiring) at iFixit. Here are some other notable fixes, and how they went.

* Battery replacement, MacBook Pro 2017 - Excellent
* Battery and USB-C port replacement, MacBook 2016 - Excellent
* Screen and battery, iPad Air 4 - Fair (Screen/digitizer separation discoloration)
* Pixel 3 rear camera & battery - Excellent
* Clear the jam and etch new grind markings on pepper grinder - Good

## Switch mods

After that Verge event, I ended up with four disassembled Nintendo Switches. I seemed to have all the parts to rebuild at least one full Switch, and it was one of the [newer variety with better battery life](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/17/new-nintendo-switch-model-with-longer-battery-life-announced). It was modified ("modded") with a translucent green plastic back, listed on eBay as not being able to sync with right Joy-cons. I opened it up and, yes, someone had snapped the right rail's cable. I replaced the rail and it took Joy-Cons again—though it looked ugly, and half the screws were the wrong size. I decided to restore it and take it a different direction.

I was a Super Nintendo teen, so [that's what I picked](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M69XR32). The kit came with a link to a YouTube video, featuring sped-up time-lapse footage of someone rushing through the job, like it was their twelfth kit that day. At one point the guy essentially yanks a Joy-Con's delicate rail ribbons out rather than flip open the tab holding them into their ZIF connector. I beg you, if you're doing this kind of mod, check out [iFixit's Joy-Con guides](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Joy-Con), at least as a second opinion.

After transplanting the two Joy-Cons' guts into new shells, finding a runaway rail release button, and almost putting the home button in upside down, I had my Super Switchtendo.

![Close-up of buttons on modded Nintendo Switch, showing purple buttons and gray joy-con case](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/switchtendo2.jpg)

This inspired my friend Adam to mod his own Switch with the same basic kit. He made it through, despite one cable snag. When he beheld his work, he realized he needed the two-tone buttons and one-piece directional pad to truly reconnect with the [controller of his youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System#/media/File:Nintendo-Super-NES-Controller.jpg). Gotta admit, it looks snazzy.

![My friend Adam's SNES-modded Switch](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/adamtendo.jpeg)

Now that I had a Switchtendo, my original Switch was just sitting there, annoyingly non-modded. I asked my sister-in-law if she'd like to own her first game system ever, and if she'd like it to look any particular way. She picked out a mod, and I got to work. I discovered too late that a right Joy-Con from my pile of parts wasn't syncing. Right Joy-Cons, even those with drifting joysticks, are multiple times more rare on eBay and other second-hand sites than left. Eventually I found one, swapped its parts in, and: pearlescent Shinytendo.

![My sister-in-law's green/purple Switch, front](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/shinytendo1.jpg)

![Sister-in-law's green/purple Switch, back](/assets/post_images/2022-01-01/shinytendo2.jpg)

There are two more Switches in the pile. Every other weekend, there's a quiet moment where I think about resurrecting just one more. Franken-Switches are addictive.

## Raspberry Pi and other tiny computers

I got into [Home Assistant](https://thepurdman.com/home_assistant/) right before 2021. I've tweaked it a few times since then, adding new gadgets and optimizing routines. I did not acquire any further Raspberry Pis in 2021, for which I commend myself.

I did, however, bring two other small, programmable circuit boards into my home.

The [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com) is a small wooden box with an LED matrix display that shows whatever you tell it to. The default displays are pretty handy: time and weather, sports scores, calendar events, countdowns to notable future events. It has an API and SDK, and I'm determined to make something of it. My dream was an occasional update on how far the closest scooter, ebike, or e-moped was to me, but I didn't find a good, reasonable-cost API for that. Working on it.

I bought an [Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit) a while back. My first goal was to program it as a [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer: 25 minutes of work, short break, repeat a total of four times, then long break. After a couple nights learning [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), and some help from other Circuit Playground owners on GitHub, I got there.

![Image of Circuit Playground Pomodoro timer]()

It plays two different Zelda cues ("Open a chest" and "Good discovery," essentially) when pomos are finished. It does a little light dance of purple and blue when you complete all four. To me, it is perfect. I didn't program 2-minute/15-minute break timers on it because, working from home, I like to get up, move around, and often get pulled into other stuff.

There's so much more inside this little guy to make use of: temperature sensor, gyroscope, and, of course, Bluetooth. Someday.

## Games

2021 was the year of [roguelike deck builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike_deck-building_game) and Western RPGs.

### PC

#### Hitman 3

#### Divinity: Original Sin 2

#### Disco Elysium

#### Prey

#### Control

#### Monster Train

#### Roguebook

#### Wildermyth

### Switch

#### [Griftlands](https://klei.com/games/griftlands)

Developer Klei entertainment gets right of first refusal in my library. I loved _Don't Starve_ and _Invisible Inc_. This one is (surprise!) a roguelike deckbuilder, set on a dystopian-ish colony planet. It's a great airport/free-moment Switch game. You can negotiate or fight your way out of every situation, and there are real pay-offs to choices you make, positive and negative.

### iOS

## Ugh, Twitter

For no monetary gain and almost no reward, I continued feeding Twitter's API in 2021. Here are five selected tweets, with the most-ish likes/faves/whatevers, minus work stuff.

[^1]: Not a smart move during COVID times. DC restaurants and bars are vaccinated-only at the moment. It was a risk, I took it.

[^2]: In Buffalo, you just expect to drive everywhere, unless it's really warm and bike-able or walking distance.

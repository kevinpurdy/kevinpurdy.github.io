There is a vast difference between being prepared to be apart and being forced to stay distant.

I've been working remotely [since 2009](https://lifehacker.com/lifehacker-workspaces-kevin-purdy-edition-5368118), when I started at Lifehacker. I spent hundreds of hours researching [the best gear and setups for home offices](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-home-office-furniture-and-supplies/) at Wirecutter. At iFixit, I am the coworker who can't hide his concern when he sees injurious ergonomics. I've got the cables, the keyboards, the dongles; the experience.

I'm a competent home cook and a decent baker. My exercises of strength training, bike riding, and lots of dog walking are still possible. I do not have kids or elderly relatives that need my care. And I can, generally, [entertain myself indoors](https://thepurdman.com/home_assistant/).

I had it better than most in 2020. I'm alive, healthy, employed. And yet, let it be on record that living through 2020 was a painful, embarrassing, tense, draining, morose, lonely, alienating, fatiguing, confusing, grief-wracking, relationship-straining, faith-destroying ordeal. We get a new year, but we're still living with this persistent disease, these exhausting and unreliable humans. There is a vaccine in 2021, but watching how it gets deployed feels very 2020.

(And I wrote that _before_ a mob of self-deluded Trump cultists breached the Capitol to take selfies, endanger lives, and shout about how things were unfair).

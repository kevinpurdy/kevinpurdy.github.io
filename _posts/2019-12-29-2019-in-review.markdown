## New Job

I [left Wirecutter and started writing at iFixit](http://thepurdman.com/leaving-wirecutter-joining-ifixit/) in April 2019. It's been a very odd, rewarding adventure so far. On any given day, I'm researching copyright legislation, touring an electronics recycling plant, interviewing [Pebble hackers](https://www.ifixit.com/News/rebble-with-a-cause-how-pebble-watches-got-their-amazing-afterlife), or digging deep into device design.

Working at iFixit for just a few months has changed my understanding of consumerism, recycling, product design, the legislative process, and, of course, how capable the average person is when it comes to fixing their things. As such, I tried to fix more things than I normally do last year.

## Repairs

![Replacing the battery on a Big Jambox at Community Beer Works brewery](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/battery_replacement_web.jpg)
_Helping a friend replace the battery in a Big Jambox at Community Beer Works, because neither of our wives wanted us drinking and scattering parts on their table that night._

Here's everything I can remember trying to fix in 2019. I think it's important to be honest about expected outcomes when trying DIY repairs. Some things you can do yourself, but bore qualified technicians offering all kinds of repair services, at competitive prices to manufacturers, is a win for everyone.

+ Replace battery in 2014 Chromebook Pixel: **Success**
+ Replace the water-logged screen in Pixel C tablet with the screen from a bricked parts-only Pixel C bought on eBay, clean corrosion on logic board: **Success**
+ Replace battery on Big Jambox: **Mixed** (Battery was replaced, but something else may have been wrong with it: wouldn't take a charge after working once, then wouldn't even work plugged in.)
+ Replace battery in MacBook Air: **Success**
+ Replace headlamp on Ford C-Max with used $150 junkyard part, instead of $550 dealer part: **Success**
+ Replace battery in friend's iPhone 6s,7 Plus phones: **Success**
+ Replace screen on iPad Mini 2nd gen: **Mixed** (Had to order a new LCD panel, too, because removing an obscene amount of very sticky broken glass injured it)
+ Replace keyboard in Chromebook Pixel 2013: **Gruesome failure** (I killed the display while trying to make this overwrought fix, probably because the battery was connected while I attempted to re-attach the cable and shorted it. Next time I read that the keys are riveted to the case, I'll think twice!)
+ Replace battery in Pixel 2: **Success**
+ iPad 2 screen separated, unreliable charging: **Success** (fixed with Sugru and pliers)
+ Galaxy S8 Plus battery and screen replacement: **Success**
+ Replace battery in Pixel 2: **Mixed/Failure** (Why did the screen die on _this_ Pixel 2 during a battery replacement, when I had pulled off the same exact fix with less experience a few months prior? Do not know. Fragile OLED displays under fragile curved glass are not my favorite technology. The battery replacement worked, though.)
+ [Remove write-protect screw from Chromebook Pixel 2013](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Install+CloudReady+for+Chrome+Updates+(or+another+OS)/123869), Toshiba Chromebook 2, various other Chromebooks: **Success** (Long-term project, for myself and for work).

## Raspberry Pi Nonsense

I owned zero [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) devices in 2018. By the end of 2019, I had two. They're addictive. They're tiny Linux computers that use very little power. They're a workshop that's always open if you have SSH or VNC access, even if it's freezing outside or you're trapped in a waiting room.

Anyways, I now have a Pi running [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/), inside this [wonderful tiny NES case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BRHDVTN), hooked up to the TV, waiting for ... a life where I have lots of time to play old games. I did get to play some Golden Sun, which I never got to try on Game Boy Advance, and it's pretty neat.

The other Pi, a version 4 with 4 GB RAM, is in my office, always on and doing weird stuff. Network stuff, downloading stuff, firewall stuff. In some ways, it's like a learning box for Linux, remote sysadmin, and stuff like that. I love it.

## Bikes

I didn't buy any bikes this year; I've staved off the armies of n+1 for another year. But I did buy new tires, cables, housings, and a few other components for the 1985-ish Peugeot mountain bike. I had once used it as a winter beater; after trying to restore it back to health after that, I don't think anyone should have to deal with Buffalo's roads in winter, ever. Humans included.

![Doofus cleaning and polishing some mountain bike wheels](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/bike_wheel.jpg)

_Me, a human in the U.S., using his limited vacation time to clean bike wheels_

I spent a good chunk of vacation scraping the salt and rust off with steel wool, cleaning and greasing everything, repacking the bearings, and trying to make it all fit again. But I'm stuck on the rear wheel. I can't make the axle go back together and fit the frame again. I had to dismantle it to get the freewheel off, but I didn't do a good enough job keeping track of the original hardware and spacings. Part of me wants to give in and just buy entirely new wheels with sealed bearings, but they don't make 26-inch wheels in that width anymore. Time to scavenge the vintage parts at the co-op and see what can be done.

## Baking (Plus a Granola Recipe)

Me, King Arthur Flour, Domino Sugar, and Organic Valley Cultured Butter: we got even closer this year.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/baking_grid_web.jpg"/>
Clockwise, from top left, and then ending in the middle:

+ Lemon meringue pie
+ Giant chocolate cake
+ Sobble Pokemon (sculpted by Matt Taylor) on a fondant-covered chocolate cake
+ Millionaire's Shortbread (Cook's Illustrated)
+ Guinness Cake (NYT)
+ Bakewell Tart (Great British Baking Show/BBC)
+ Thick & Chewy cookies (Cook's)
+ Chocolate Beet Cake (Good Housekeeping)
+ Almost-No-Knead bread (Cook's)

I wrote about my four-year quest to make a "no-knead" bread, rife with [dense little failure discs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/LAhiXMhbVhYjWMMu7), for [Buffalo Eats' favorite meal roundup](http://www.buffaloeats.org/2020/01/01/meals-of-2019-part-4/).

Normally the thing I bake most is cookies—lots and lots and lots of cookies—for my Ride for Roswell patrons ([email me](mailto:kspurdy@gmail.com?subject=Roswell Cookies 2020) if you want in for 2020!). This year, however, the thing I baked most was granola.

<img align="right" src="/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/granola.jpg" width="300"/>It started with [this recipe in NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014304-eleven-madison-park-granola), pulled from the cookbook of modernist restaurant [Eleven Madison Park](https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/). It is the granola given to guests at the end of their meal, intended for breakfast the next morning. It's a nice gesture, earned by paying nearly $350 per person for a dinner with no set menu. Moving on.

I made it once because I had a bunch of the ingredients on-hand, taking up space in the cupboard. My in-laws were over, and I offered it with some Fage yogurt for breakfast. I don't know if I've ever heard such praise for something I made. My in-laws are pretty picky about granola, because they are, well, granola types. Something about the olive oil and salt as a backing, the varied textures, the good amount of protein amongst the maple-covered carbs. I kept making it, for ourselves and for friends. Ever make something really simple that gets more praise than the really complex stuff you sweat over? Yeah, it's like the social media equivalent of baking.

Here's an annotated version of that granola. By all means, though, subscribe to [NYT Cooking](cooking.nytimes.com), where I found the original, and which my house finds invaluable for meal inspiration.

### Kevin Madison Park Granola

**Tools**
+ Half-sheet (regular size) baking sheet
+ Parchment paper or silicone baking mat
+ Large bowl
+ Small saucepan
+ Spatula

**Ingredients**
+ 2 3/4 cups rolled oats (i.e. _not_ instant oats)
+ 1 cup shelled pistachios
    * Or almonds, walnuts, pecans, cashews, chopped about as fine as pistachios
+ 1 cup unsweetened coconut chips
    * Flakes/strands are okay, but chips add a lot of crunch and texture. Don't use sweetened, whatever you do.
+ 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
    * Or sunflower seds, squash seeds, or even hemp seeds, rough-ground flax, or chia seeds, if you wanna roll that way.
+ 1 tbsp kosher salt
    * A supposedly controversial aspect of the original recipe, but nobody has really complained about this amount.
+ 1/2 cup light brown sugar
    * Or dark brown, or other kinds of funky sugars. You've got maple syrup to lean on, no need to be strict.
    * I usually go lighter on this in my recipes, either not packing the cup or going scant. It's fine as-is, but I feel like it's not necessary.
+ 1/3 cup maple syrup
    * You could probably do some soft/easy-flowing, or thinned-out honey instead, but maple syrup does a lot of work in this granola. As with sugar, I go a bit scant.
+ 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
    * I don't mess with this, usually. If you didn't have EVOO on-hand, maybe coconut or avocado or other oils would suffice, but the flavor of roasted olive oil sings.
+ 3/4 cup dried sour cherries
    * They're great, but they're expensive and not always easy to find. Any kind of dried, sweet, but tangy/sour fruit works here: dried blueberries, currants, cranberries, or (if you chop them up) dates, apricots, etc. Raisins, obviously, can work, but they're kind of a bog-standard granola ingredient.

Start the oven heating to 300. In a small saucepan, pour in the sugar, syrup, and oil, and start on low heat.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together dry non-sweet ingredients (oats, nuts, chips, seeds, salt). Watch the saucepan, and pull it off the heat when the sugar has dissolved into the liquids (or a very slight boil is starting). Fold the liquids into the dry ingredients with a spatula, until they're evenly coated.

On a rimmed baking sheet, lined with parchment or a silpat, spread out the granola, as even as you can get it. Place in the oven (I use a lower rack, probably doesn't matter). Bake 35-40 minutes. I stir it every 12 minutes with a spatula, for a total of 36 minutes. After 35 minutes, it's up to you how brown and toasty you want your granola.

When it's ready, remove from the oven and immediately mix in the dried fruit. In my head, this softens them up and causes them to trade their sweet/bitter flavors with the still-hot roasted stuff, but who knows. Wait until the granola is cool to store it.

## Writing

Other than this post you're reading, the previous post about my job change, and some odd press releases or text contributions? No real writing outside work. No value judgment at this time! Just how it was last year.

<a name="lifting"></a>
## Lifting

This year really taught me that you have to be in it for the long haul. I had some long stretches where I had to step back and watch my numbers go down: work travel, injuries from lifting, injuries from other stuff, the holidays.

Much like you develop core strength, accessory muscles, and good form for the weights, you can, it seems, build resilient strength for setbacks. I've had so many now that it's just exhausting to host a small tantrum and act like it's all outside my own control. There's no shame in not being able to maintain a pro-am exercise schedule while you live you life. Just walk up to the weight, pick it up, and realize that doing something, anything, is better than walking out.

I know, that doesn't sound like me at all! But it's working.

## Reading

I deleted my Goodreads account, because I didn't like the idea of Amazon knowing what, when, and where I read, or which books my friends like. Weird, right? Here's what I do remember reading. (And, yes, a lot of these are Amazon links, if I can't find a proper book/author page. If you're going to buy through Amazon, please consider buying used, especially from a non-profit or independent bookstore).

## Games

### Switch

![Stardew Valley screenshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/stardew_valley.jpg)

**Stardew Valley:** I stopped working on my first farm after 100 hours. All year long, I saw the game pop up on lists of stress-relieving, low-key games, games for people who aren't really into games, etc. Finally, a mutiplayer update arrived on the Switch, so I nudged my wife to try it, with the idea that I could jump in and help when needed.

Nearly 30 hours later, I am a happy tenant on my wife's farm. I'm learning how to just go along with someone else's plans, not optimize everything just for the sake of it, and divide up work on a day-to-day basis. It's really a remarkable game.

**Tetris 99:** I'm not all that good at battle-royale tetris, but my wife is brutally efficient. She usually places in the top 10, often in the top five. It's a big part of why she got her own Switch Lite—I didn't want to deprive her of dunking on other people's weak lines while I was away or playing ...

![Image from Witcher 3 on Switch: Geralt looks at his vineyard and says, "Pretty vast..."](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/witcher_3.jpg)

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** I'd already [played through once on PC](http://thepurdman.com/2017-in-review/#games). The graphics on the Switch are a far cry from that. Sometimes you can nearly feel the Switch trudging like it's on mile 18 of a marathon. I don't care; I don't think tri-linear filtering or water ripple effects are why this game is one of my all-time favorites. I'm trying out different decisions, new character builds and strategies, reliving old favorite moments, and doing it in an airport terminal, or while rice is cooking for dinner.

**Wargroove:** Dug it, well worth the tiny price. I really like the idea of asynchronous games you can play turn by turn with friends, remotely.

![Night in the Woods screenshot, featuring Pastabilities, which is an honest-to-God restaurant in Syracuse that seems like parody, but is just a restaurant everyone recommends](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/night_in_the_woods.jpg)

**Night in the Woods:** Sasha at Wirecutter told me that I would love this game, over and over. I grew up in a past-its-glory upstate NY town, she knew, and if I didn't like the vibe of this game, well, she doubted whether she knew anything about me. Sasha, you were right! This game was wonderful, and lasted exactly as long as it should, and had a real impact on my brain-feels.

**My Friend Pedro:** Neat core mechanics, but I didn't love the vibe or plot, however thin a layer they were supposed to be. Games that mock you to redo levels for a better score? Not my favorite, but then, they also make it easier to realize you don't care enough to do better.

**Untitled Goose Game:** I bought it before a 5-hour flight, and it was just perfect for it. Like the good person tweeted:

[<img src="/assets/post_images/goosegame_tweet.jpg">](https://twitter.com/p01arst0rm/status/1177717337845374976)

![Image from Link's Awakening on Switch](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/links_awakening.jpg)

**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening:** The art style is really neat, the music is top-notch, and the nostalgia kicks were fun. But this is one of a growing number of Nintendo first-party games that I've bought, played immediately, then re-sold to recoup about 2/3 the cost. Not a ton of replay value, but glad to hang with an old friend for a while. Speaking of old friends!

![Super Metroid screnshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/super_metroid.jpg)

**Super Metroid:** The minute I saw that Super Metroid was coming to the Switch's free NES/SNES game library, I knew I would be playing through it, yet again. And I did. With maybe 10 years distance since my last play-through (maybe?), I notice how some of the puzzles and secrets are seemingly impossible to intuit without a quick Google search, or the kind of time kids have. Or maybe the web has made me lazy. Or both!

![Dragon Quest Builders screenshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/dragonquest_builders.jpg)

**Dragon Quest Builders 1/2:** Based entirely on [Jason Schreier's review](https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-builders-the-kotaku-review-1822880632), I tried out a demo of "_Minecraft_ with actual tasks." One week later, I had bought a used copy on eBay and was well into building something way too elaborate for what was required. Weird humor that feels like all the mistranslated humor of my JRPG youth (but intentional?), interesting tasks, and really good performance on the Switch.

2 contained lots of fixes and upgrades for the systems, controls, and gameplay loops. I'm maybe halfway through it, but I dropped it for other games. I'll probably get back in, but it might be easier to OD on blocks and tasks than, say, endlessly varied strategy games. LIKE ...

**Into the Breach:** I have never really stopped playing this game. It's installed on every computer I own (even this Pixelbook, via Linux/Steam), it's on my Switch. I almost hope they never release DLC for it. I've never been so driven to 100% a game. UNLIKE ...

**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:** I ended up selling this. Too demanding of my time to learn, advance, or just enjoy. I did enjoy playing against friends online, when it worked. Footnote: I went to a local Smash tournament, big-screened inside a historic theater, and watching that and feeling the cohesion and camaraderie of the competitors and crowd was honestly thrilling. And way more fun than endlessly changing controller settings or fighting AI opponents to unlock characters.

### PC

**Slay the Spire:** _Magic: The Gathering_ is off-putting, both in card and computer form, because it feels like I could never catch up, or stop spending money. Ditto _Hearthstone_. But a contained, single-player deckbuilding game with rogue-ish progression? Oh heck yes. I have installed this on a PC, a Mac, and a Chromebook, have different progress on each of them, don't even care that it's inefficient.

**Baldur's Gate II / Knights of the Old Republic I/II:** Maybe it was the Switch release of BioWare's classic CRPGs, or the endless _Star Wars_ discussions, but it felt like every game critic personally emailed me this year to remind me that these are among the most well-regarded RPGs of all time. I ... cannot play them. I've put a few hours into each one. The pause-and-correct battle system gives me actual stress headaches. The potato-gon graphics on KOTOR are hard to stomach now, which is not LucasArts' fault _per se_, but ... I just didn't want to hang around for the great writing that I was told would come.

**Dishonored 2:** Speaking of great writing! Dug this game a whole bunch. Improved on its predecessor, provided just the right mix of open exploration and guideposts, and the voice acting! Voice acting in open-world games often gets extremely old, to the point of irony ("[then I took an arrow in the knee](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee)"). I could listen to the NPCs in Dishonored talk forever.

**Wolfenstein: The New Order:** What a fun ride. I am very sad that killing Nazis—really, just killing lots of Nazis, and wanting more of them to be killed—has even more real-world context now than when this was released in 2014. But it wouldn't work if the mechanics, the feel, the voice acting, and even a lot of the writing didn't sing and glide.

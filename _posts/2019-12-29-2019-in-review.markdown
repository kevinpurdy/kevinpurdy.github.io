## Games

### Switch

**Stardew Valley:** I stopped working on my first farm after 100 hours. All year long, I saw the game pop up on lists of stress-relieving, low-key games, games for people who aren't really into games, etc. Finally, a mutiplayer update arrived on the Switch, so I nudged my wife to try it, with the idea that I could jump in and help when needed.

Nearly 30 hours later, I am a happy tenant on my wife's farm. I'm learning how to just go along with someone else's plans, not optimize everything just for the sake of it, and divide up work on a day-to-day basis. It's really a remarkable game.

**Tetris 99:**

**Wargroove:**

**My Friend Pedro:**

**Untitled Goose Game:**

**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening:**

**Super Metroid:**

**DragonQuest Builders 1/2:**

**Into the Breach:** I have never really stopped playing this game. It's installed on every computer I own (even this Pixelbook, via Linux/Steam), it's on my Switch. I almost hope they never release DLC for it. I don't want to know what's beyond 100%-ing this game.

**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:** I ended up selling this. Too demanding of my time to learn, advance, or just enjoy. I did enjoy playing against friends online, when it worked.

### PC

**Slay the Spire:**

**Baldur's Gate II / Knights of the Old Republic I/II:**

**Dishonored 2:**

**Wolfenstein II: The New Order:**

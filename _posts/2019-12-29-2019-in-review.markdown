## Baking (Plus a Granola Recipe)

Me, King Arthur Flour, Domino Sugars and, sometimes, Organic Valley Cultured Butter: we got even closer this year.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/baking_grid_web.jpg"/>
Clockwise, from top left, and then ending in the middle:

+ Lemon meringue pie
+ Giant chocolate cake
+ Sobble Pokemon (sculpted by Matt Taylor) on a fondant-covered chocolate cake
+ Millionaire's Shortbread (Cook's Illustrated)
+ Guinness Cake (NYT)
+ Bakewell Tart (Great British Baking Show/BBC)
+ Thick & Chewy cookies (Cook's)
+ Chocolate Beet Cake (Good Housekeeping)
+ Almost-No-Knead bread (Cook's)

I wrote about my four-year quest to make a "no-knead" bread, rife with [dense little failure discs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/LAhiXMhbVhYjWMMu7), for [Buffalo Eats' favorite meal roundup](http://www.buffaloeats.org/2020/01/01/meals-of-2019-part-4/).

Normally the thing I bake most is cookies—lots and lots and lots of cookies—for my Ride for Roswell patrons ([email me](mailto:kspurdy@gmail.com?subject=Roswell Cookies 2020) if you want in for 2020!). This year, however, the thing I baked most was granola.

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/granola.jpg" width="300"/>
It started with [this recipe in NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014304-eleven-madison-park-granola), pulled from the cookbook of modernist restaurant [Eleven Madison Park](https://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/). It is the granola given to guests at the end of their meal, intended for breakfast the next morning. It's a nice gesture, earned by paying nearly $350 per person for a dinner with no set menu. Moving on.

I made it once because I had a bunch of the ingredients on-hand, taking up space in the cupboard. My in-laws were over, and I offered it with some Fage yogurt for breakfast. I don't know if I've ever heard such praise for something I made. My in-laws are pretty picky about granola, because they are, well, granola types. Something about the olive oil and salt as a backing, the varied textures, the good amount of protein amongst the maple-covered carbs. I kept making it, for ourselves and for friends. Ever make something really simple that gets more praise than the really complex stuff you sweat over? Yeah, it's like the social media equivalent of baking.



Here's an annotated version of that granola. By all means, though, subscribe to [NYT Cooking](cooking.nytimes.com), where I found the original, and which my house finds invaluable for meal inspiration.

### Kevin Madison Park Granola

**Tools**
+ Half-sheet (regular size) baking sheet
+ Parchment paper or silicone baking mat
+ Large bowl
+ Small saucepan
+ Spatula

**Ingredients**
+ 2 3/4 cups rolled oats (i.e. _not_ instant oats)
+ 1 cup shelled pistachios
    * Or almonds, walnuts, pecans, cashews, chopped about as fine as pistachios
+ 1 cup unsweetened coconut chips
    * Flakes/strands are okay, but chips add a lot of crunch and texture. Don't use sweetened, whatever you do.
+ 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
    * Or sunflower seds, squash seeds, or even hemp seeds, rough-ground flax, or chia seeds, if you wanna roll that way.
+ 1 tbsp kosher salt
    * A supposedly controversial aspect of the original recipe, but nobody has really complained about this amount.
+ 1/2 cup light brown sugar
    * Or dark brown, or other kinds of funky sugars. You've got maple syrup to lean on, no need to be strict.
    * I usually go lighter on this in my recipes, either not packing the cup or going scant. It's fine as-is, but I feel like it's not necessary.
+ 1/3 cup maple syrup
    * You could probably do some soft/easy-flowing, or thinned-out honey instead, but maple syrup does a lot of work in this granola. As with sugar, I go a bit scant.
+ 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
    * I don't mess with this, usually. If you didn't have EVOO on-hand, maybe coconut or avocado or other oils would suffice, but the flavor of roasted olive oil sings.
+ 3/4 cup dried sour cherries
    * They're great, but they're expensive and not always easy to find. Any kind of dried, sweet, but tangy/sour fruit works here: dried blueberries, currants, cranberries, or (if you chop them up) dates, apricots, etc. Raisins, obviously, can work, but they're kind of a bog-standard granola ingredient.

Start the oven heating to 300. In a small saucepan, pour in the sugar, syrup, and oil, and start on low heat.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together dry non-sweet ingredients (oats, nuts, chips, seeds, salt). Watch the saucepan, and pull it off the heat when the sugar has dissolved into the liquids (or a very slight boil is starting). Fold the liquids into the dry ingredients with a spatula, until they're evenly coated.

On a rimmed baking sheet, lined with parchment or a silpat, spread out the granola, as even as you can get it. Place in the oven (I use a lower rack, probably doesn't matter). Bake 35-40 minutes. I stir it every 12 minutes with a spatula, for a total of 36 minutes. After 35 minutes, it's up to you how brown and toasty you want your granola.

When it's ready, remove from the oven and immediately mix in the dried fruit. In my head, this softens them up and causes them to trade their sweet/bitter flavors with the still-hot roasted stuff, but who knows. Wait until the granola is cool to store it.

## Reading

I deleted my Goodreads account, because I didn't like the idea of Amazon knowing what, when, and where I read, or which books my friends like. Weird, right? Here's what I do remember reading. (And, yes, a lot of these are Amazon links, if I can't find a proper book/author page. If you're going to buy through Amazon, please consider buying used, especially from a non-profit or independent bookstore).

## Games

### Switch

![Stardew Valley screenshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/stardew_valley.jpg)

**Stardew Valley:** I stopped working on my first farm after 100 hours. All year long, I saw the game pop up on lists of stress-relieving, low-key games, games for people who aren't really into games, etc. Finally, a mutiplayer update arrived on the Switch, so I nudged my wife to try it, with the idea that I could jump in and help when needed.

Nearly 30 hours later, I am a happy tenant on my wife's farm. I'm learning how to just go along with someone else's plans, not optimize everything just for the sake of it, and divide up work on a day-to-day basis. It's really a remarkable game.

**Tetris 99:** I'm not all that good at battle-royale tetris, but my wife is brutally efficient. She usually places in the top 10, often in the top five. It's a big part of why she got her own Switch Lite—I didn't want to deprive her of dunking on other people's weak lines while I was away or playing ...

![Image from Witcher 3 on Switch: Geralt looks at his vineyard and says, "Pretty vast..."](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/witcher_3.jpg)

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** I'd already [played through once on PC](http://thepurdman.com/2017-in-review/#games). The graphics on the Switch are a far cry from that. Sometimes you can nearly feel the Switch trudging like it's on mile 18 of a marathon. I don't care; I don't think tri-linear filtering or water ripple effects are why this game is one of my all-time favorites. I'm trying out different decisions, new character builds and strategies, reliving old favorite moments, and doing it in an airport terminal, or while rice is cooking for dinner.

**Wargroove:** Dug it, well worth the tiny price. I really like the idea of asynchronous games you can play turn by turn with friends, remotely.

**My Friend Pedro:** Neat core mechanics, but I didn't love the vibe or plot, however thin a layer they were supposed to be. Games that mock you to redo levels for a better score? Not my favorite, but then, they also make it easier to realize you don't care enough to do better.

**Untitled Goose Game:** I bought it before a 5-hour flight, and it was just perfect for it. Like the good person tweeted:

[<img src="/assets/post_images/goosegame_tweet.jpg">](https://twitter.com/p01arst0rm/status/1177717337845374976)

![Image from Link's Awakening on Switch](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/links_awakening.jpg)

**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening:** The art style is really neat, the music is top-notch, and the nostalgia kicks were fun. But this is one of a growing number of Nintendo first-party games that I've bought, played immediately, then re-sold to recoup about 2/3 the cost. Not a ton of replay value, but glad to hang with an old friend for a while. Speaking of old friends!

![Super Metroid screnshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/super_metroid.jpg)

**Super Metroid:** The minute I saw that Super Metroid was coming to the Switch's free NES/SNES game library, I knew I would be playing through it, yet again. And I did. With maybe 10 years distance since my last play-through (maybe?), I notice how some of the puzzles and secrets are seemingly impossible to intuit without a quick Google search, or the kind of time kids have. Or maybe the web has made me lazy. Or both!

![Dragon Quest Builders screenshot](/assets/post_images/2019-12-29/dragonquest_builders.jpg)

**Dragon Quest Builders 1/2:** Based entirely on [Jason Schreier's review](https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-builders-the-kotaku-review-1822880632), I tried out a demo of "_Minecraft_ with actual tasks." One week later, I had bought a used copy on eBay and was well into building something way too elaborate for what was required. Weird humor that feels like all the mistranslated humor of my JRPG youth (but intentional?), interesting tasks, and really good performance on the Switch.

2 contained lots of fixes and upgrades for the systems, controls, and gameplay loops. I'm maybe halfway through it, but I dropped it for other games. I'll probably get back in, but it might be easier to OD on blocks and tasks than, say, endlessly varied strategy games. LIKE ...

**Into the Breach:** I have never really stopped playing this game. It's installed on every computer I own (even this Pixelbook, via Linux/Steam), it's on my Switch. I almost hope they never release DLC for it. I've never been so driven to 100% a game. UNLIKE ...

**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:** I ended up selling this. Too demanding of my time to learn, advance, or just enjoy. I did enjoy playing against friends online, when it worked. Footnote: I went to a local Smash tournament, big-screened inside a historic theater, and watching that and feeling the cohesion and camaraderie of the competitors and crowd was honestly thrilling. And way more fun than endlessly changing controller settings or fighting AI opponents to unlock characters.

### PC

**Slay the Spire:** _Magic: The Gathering_ is off-putting, both in card and computer form, because it feels like I could never catch up, or stop spending money. Ditto _Hearthstone_. But a contained, single-player deckbuilding game with rogue-ish progression? Oh heck yes. I have installed this on a PC, a Mac, and a Chromebook, have different progress on each of them, don't even care that it's inefficient.

**Baldur's Gate II / Knights of the Old Republic I/II:** Maybe it was the Switch release of BioWare's classic CRPGs, or the endless _Star Wars_ discussions, but it felt like every game critic personally emailed me this year to remind me that these are among the most well-regarded RPGs of all time. I ... cannot play them. I've put a few hours into each one. The pause-and-correct battle system gives me actual stress headaches. The potato-gon graphics on KOTOR are hard to stomach now, which is not LucasArts' fault _per se_, but ... I just didn't want to hang around for the great writing that I was told would come.

**Dishonored 2:** Speaking of great writing! Dug this game a whole bunch. Improved on its predecessor, provided just the right mix of open exploration and guideposts, and the voice acting! Voice acting in open-world games often gets extremely old, to the point of irony ("[then I took an arrow in the knee](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee)"). I could listen to the NPCs in Dishonored talk forever.

**Wolfenstein: The New Order:** What a fun ride. I am very sad that killing Nazis—really, just killing lots of Nazis, and wanting more of them to be killed—has even more real-world context now than when this was released in 2014. But it wouldn't work if the mechanics, the feel, the voice acting, and even a lot of the writing didn't sing and glide.

## Games

### Switch

**Stardew Valley:** I stopped working on my first farm after 100 hours. All year long, I saw the game pop up on lists of stress-relieving, low-key games, games for people who aren't really into games, etc. Finally, a mutiplayer update arrived on the Switch, so I nudged my wife to try it, with the idea that I could jump in and help when needed.

Nearly 30 hours later, I am a happy tenant on my wife's farm. I'm learning how to just go along with someone else's plans, not optimize everything just for the sake of it, and divide up work on a day-to-day basis. It's really a remarkable game.

**Tetris 99:** I'm not all that good at battle-royale tetris, but my wife is brutally efficient. She usually places in the top 10, often in the top five. It's a big part of why she got her own Switch Liteâ€”I didn't want to deprive her of dunking on other people's weak lines while I was away or playing ...

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt:** I'd already [played through once on PC](http://thepurdman.com/2017-in-review/#games). The graphics on the Switch are a far cry from that. Sometimes you can nearly feel the Switch trudging like it's on mile 18 of a marathon. I don't care; I don't think tri-linear filtering or water ripple effects are why this game is one of my all-time favorites. I'm trying out different decisions, a new character build and strategies, reliving old favorite moments, and I can do it in anairport terminal or on the couch while the rice is cooking.

**Wargroove:**

**My Friend Pedro:**

**Untitled Goose Game:**

**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening:**

**Super Metroid:**

**DragonQuest Builders 1/2:**

**Into the Breach:** I have never really stopped playing this game. It's installed on every computer I own (even this Pixelbook, via Linux/Steam), it's on my Switch. I almost hope they never release DLC for it. I don't want to know what's beyond 100%-ing this game.

**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate:** I ended up selling this. Too demanding of my time to learn, advance, or just enjoy. I did enjoy playing against friends online, when it worked.

### PC

**Slay the Spire:**

**Baldur's Gate II / Knights of the Old Republic I/II:**

**Dishonored 2:**

**Wolfenstein II: The New Order:**

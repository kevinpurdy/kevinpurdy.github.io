## Podcasts

**[Hard Pass](http://acast.com/hardpass)** - Two business reporters, hating on things that seem stupid, unfair, and absolutely not worth anyone's time, or at least 10 minutes of anyone's time. Like having a very smart friend you meet for drinks in the financial district.

**[Esquire Classic](http://classic.esquire.com)** - Readings, behind-the-scenes, and interviews with authors and editors of Esquire's best stuff. Which is saying something.- 

**[The Adventure Zone](http://adventurezone.libsyn.com/podcast)** - [Matt Taylor](http://insertartisthere.tumblr.com) gently nudged me into this. The first episode is too long (listen to the "super cut" that shows up in your feed), and enjoy some seriously funny second-hand _Dungeons & Dragons_.

## Books

**Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary** - [Wrote about it on GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1747743112?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1).

**Up in the Old Hotel** - [Reading it now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210783.Up_in_the_Old_Hotel). One of my favorite things about Mitchell's writing is the way he writes ledes. He just tells you why he is about to spend thousands of words on somebody.

+ "McSorley's occupies the ground floor of a red-brick tenement at 15 Seventh Street, just off Cooper Square, where the Bowery ends. It was opened in 1854 and is the oldest saloon in New York City. In eighty-eight years it has had four owners―an Irish immigrant, his son, a retired policeman, and his daughter―and all of them have been opposed to change."

+ "A bossy, yellow-haired blonde named Mazie P. Gordon is a celebrity on the Bowery."

+ "When I have time to kill, I sometimes go to the basement of a brownstone tenement on Fifty-ninth Street, three-quarters of a block west of Columbus Circle, and sit on a rat-gnawed Egyptian mummy and cut up touches with Charles Eugene Cassell, an old Yankee for whose bitter and disorderly mind I have great respect."

And, of course:

+ Joe Gould is a blithe and emaciated little man who has been a notable in the cafeterias, diners, barrooms, and dumps of Greenwich Village for a quarter of a century. He sometimes brags rather wryly that he is the last of the bohemians. "All the others fell by the wayside," he says. "Some are in the grave, some are in the loony bin, and some are in the advertising business."
 

**Super Mario 3 (Boss Fight Books)** - [Wrote about it on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1749096627?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)

## Games

**[Fallout: New Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas)** - Playing through this again, but in "[hardcore mode](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Hardcore_mode), where ammunition has weight, sleeping doesn't barely heal you, and you have to cook meat before you eat it, or else you'll be weak. So, you know, real life.

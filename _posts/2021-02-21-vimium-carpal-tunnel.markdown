Here's something I've been typing to a lot of people lately: f.

There are many reasons to type "f" and mean it these days, in these United States. But what I'm doing is trying to navigate around a web page with [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/). Sometimes I forget to escape out of a text box I had in focus, so I type "f" and then, instead of magically turning the whole page into a human-navigable documents, I just type "f" into a box. It's not a bad trade-off, considering the alternative is having to ice my forearm or elbow.

I don't know which is the culprit, or if they worked as a team. But one or more of these things caught up with me in early 2021, and left me with what at least one nurse practitioner diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome:

+ A bad mouse grip on too-small mice, where my palm dragged behind the mouse
+ Very long hours in front of a computer for work
+ Some additional hours in front of a computer, for fun (pandemic self-capture)
+ A lot of [research into ergonomics for Wirecutter guides](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Anytimes.com%2Fwirecutter+%22kevin+purdy%22+ergonomics&ia=web), which gave me an advanced beginner's understanding of angles/extension/posture, but might have also made me overconfident in my own setup.
+ Losing the ability to do most anything else that doesn't involve a laptop, phone, game controller, book, or mouse.
+ No longer being young enough that my body easily recovers from doing stupid bad things to it.

So I've had to get serious about my desk setup and my wrist health. I'm sharing my discoveries so far, in the hopes that someone searching for solutions might find it helpful.

## Vimium: Stop using a mouse to get around web pages

Web pages have come very far, but they are still mostly a collection of text, images, and links that head out or do something if you click on certain text or images. That's a good thing. The most common way to go places, copy things, and click buttons is the mouse. But using the mouse hurts me after a while. So I doubled down on my favorite Chrome extension, [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/). And, wherever possible, I use the web-page version of any app I need.

Right now I'm listening to Spotify through the [web player](http://play.spotify.com/). It's barely different from the desktop app, because the desktop app is [essentially a pre-packed Chrome browser pointed at Spotify](https://jonathanchang.org/blog/setting-up-spotifyd-on-macos/). Here's what it looks like in a Chrome window.

Here's what happens when I focus the Spotify window and tap "f," the Vimium key that lets you "click" on any link on the page using keyboard shortcuts.

It doesn't look very pretty, but it's temporary, and it's damned useful. From your keyboard, you can play/pause, skip tracks, turn on shuffle or random, send music to other devices, focus the volume or time slider, jump to some other track or playlist, and so on. You'd do these things by, as noted, tapping "f," then typing any of the little yellow shortcuts to "click" that link: f-fk would pause, f-sk would favorite/like the song, f-ad would jump to the Tuareg Guitar playlist, etc.

Tapping "f" also lets you focus text boxes to type in. Whenever your cursor or browser is locked into a text box, you can get out of it by tapping Escape on your keyboard, or often Tab will move your focus to the next page element. One side effect of using Vimium is getting mad at websites that pre-emptively steal your mouse focus.

Once you get the hang of the little yellow shortcuts, you can go further. Tapping capital "F" lets you open links in new tabs. Tapping "y" instead lets you _copy_ links into your clipboard. "yy" copys the current page's URL to your clipboard. If that's all you used Vimium for, quick copying, that would save you a good deal of mousing, right-clicking, and other arm movement.

You can also navigate pages with Vimium. The j & k keys scroll up and down as you hold them down. Tapping d & u scroll about 50% down and up the page.

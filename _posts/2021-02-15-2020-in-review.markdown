## Moved to DC

I wrote last year about what it was like [leaving Buffalo after nearly 20 years](https://thepurdman.com/leaving-buffalo/). What's it like moving to DC? Because of the pandemic, I have some solid guesses and a few anecdotes. But I don't really live in a full-fledged city that's alive yet. Soon, I hope, but so does everybody.

The days and weeks leading up to the move were about as stressful as any stretch of time I can remember. We lived in a big Victorian house, with an attic, basement, backyard, and garage for 11 years. We were moving to a 2-bedroom apartment. We knew the big-picture things that had to go. Why else would I make a 3D model of the new apartment floor plans, measure all our furniture, and see which items fit? Except our apartment building gave us the penthouse floor plan, labeled as if it were our second-floor apartment. Whoops.

Clutter is a bunch of decisions you haven't made yet. When you buy a house, you sometimes take on the indecision of the previous owner. And then your parents and relatives and friends, seeing you with all that empty space, toss in some deferred decisions, too. Even after you make the "get rid of it" decision, you have to make the disposal decision: sell, give away, donate, or trash. And then: properly trash, or irresponsibly trash.

I remember frantically texting my friends who had moved out of Buffalo homes before. What's the dump like? Will it really be open at 11 a.m. on a Wednesday? What if I don't have a paper bill to prove my residency, will they take a printed-out copy of my emailed statements? You picture your last days of moving being tearful goodbyes and wisful stares at your front door. There is some of that. There is also praying that one of your neighbors has a hammer drill that's charged, because yours is drained, the last hex bolt holding this table together is stripped to Hell, and the person who bought this table on Facebook Marketplace says they're on their way from 10 miles away.

I did, however, discover the joy that is belonging to [your local Buy Nothing group](https://buynothingproject.org/), and selling things on eBay like you have nothing to lose. I was so inspired by this discovery, I wrote the kind of [rant about personal responsibility nobody wants to read](https://buynothingproject.org/). Seriously, though: lose your second-hand guilt, if you're lucky enough to have it.

Liz and I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_(Washington,_D.C.)">Southeast D.C</a>. It's not what most people think of when they think of the city—it's not the quadrant with the White House or the museums or the stadium or the hip strips where young political staffers live. It's perfect for us, as we get our bearings and learn how things work. We've done some DC things, taken some great walks and bike trips, and smiled at the still relatively mild winters they get here (though this year is harsher than most, locals say).

I like how pervasive bike culture, bikeshare systems, and scooters are. At some point I will probably appreciate the public transit. The food options are plentiful, the Eastern Market wonderful, the beer much better than Ryan Nagelhout said it would be. But, again, this is a city that's half asleep under the modern, rolling, soft quarantine.

I'm lucky to have been able to move here, lucky to be able to work from inside our apartment, and lucky to have a wife committed to making a difference at her government job. I miss Buffalo, believe me. But there's a lot that is exciting about this big new thing.

## The Buffalo Bills, of All Things

![H-dogs repping for his team](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/howard_says_go_bills.jpg)

I have been a lifelong fan of the Buffalo Bills. My parents told me that my third and fourth words ever spoken were "Go" and "Buffalo," because my dad would put me on the floor in front of the TV during Bills games and nudge me to say it. I had to go to bed before [Super Bowl XXV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXV) was over, but my dad woke me up. "Kev-boy," he said, "The Bills are about to win the Super Bowl. Come watch."

The Bills [did not win that Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Right_(Buffalo_Bills)). I lost a 25-cent bet to Matt Kline; I think I had to skimp on lunch to repay it. The Bills did not win the next three Super Bowls they appeared in. The Bills have never won a Super Bowl. There are 12 teams that have never won the NFL championship, but let me tell you, it feels like the Bills _most_ never won it.

Being a lifelong fan does not make me an steadfast supporter of the Bills. I attended roughly one home game a year when I lived in Buffalo; someone would just end up inviting me. They have ranged from the [31-0 season opening trouncing of the Patriots in 2003](https://billswire.usatoday.com/2017/09/07/throwback-thursday-buffalo-bills-shut-out-new-england-patriots-31-0/) to the [6-3 Browns-Bills purgatory of 2009](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/270428-worst-game-ever-buffalo-vs-cleveland-review).The team went 17 years between making the playoffs, which is coincidentally most of when I lived in Buffalo. The Bills subsumed and devastated talent and churned through coaches. Drunken lunacy at tailgates was more newsworthy than the team itself, up until 2017. That's when the Bills benched their entirely competent starting quarterback in favor of [the arguably worst quarterback of all time](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/11/04/why-nathan-peterman-is-the-worst-starting-quarterback-in-nfl-history/).

Beyond the comedy, I stopped paying attention to the team after that. And then, this year, with nobody expecting much, things changed. Quarterback Josh Allen [got much better](https://www.theringer.com/nfl-playoffs/2021/1/12/22226307/josh-allen-bills-nfl-playoffs), something that rarely happens in the NFL and never happened with a Bills player. The coach made non-cowardly play calls and down decisions. The games were good. We beat the Patriots twice in one season, [the first time since 1999](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2020/12/28/when-was-the-last-time-the-bills-swept-the-patriots-in-a-season/). We made the playoffs, handily.

It got to the point where, at my Monday morning work meetings, I was providing updates on what was happening in my former city ... in slide presentations.

![Bills game work presentation, slide 1](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/bills_slide1.jpg)

![Bills game work presentation, slide 3](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/bills_slide3.jpg)

The Bills did not make or win the Super Bowl. But, for the first time in 21 years, the season ended, and I was hopeful for the next one. Not the next one _if we draft a miracle quarterback_, not the season _after we fire this stupid idiot coach_. This team, next year. I was, in 2020, very grateful for it.

## Repairs

Given that I sold my Buffalo home in 2020, I did a lot of little repairs around the place. My favorite was using two-part epoxy to fill in a bit of rotted wood on the front step. The woodwork was complicated enough that I wouldn't have been able to pull the whole thing and cut new boards for it, nor hire anybody during a pandemic to do so.

I didn't really understand what [this stuff](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/paint-and-supplies/tape-glues-and-adhesives/glues-and-epoxy/12778) was until this job came up. It's like a real-world Minecraft material: you create a block of matter that can fill in for other stuff, sand it, paint it. When I was done, you could barely tell there was ever a soft spot or hole in the wood. It was a three-inch hole that felt like 100-yard victory.

![Wii controller, opened up](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/wii_controller.jpg)

To give away a Nintendo Wii, to a father with two kids who was really glad for it, I fixed one of the non-responsive controllers. Turned out it was just in need of a thorough contact/board cleaning with some 90% isopropyl alcohol. Hardest part was keeping the buttons and little rubber gaskets from falling off the table.

![Two orange wiring caps peeking out of a plaster wall](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/wonderful_wiring.jpg)

I also replaced the last of the old sconces on the walls. There are things I'll miss about our old 1878 Victorian, but not working with plaster and tightly-packed cloth-covered wire with no real markings.

In the new (2019) apartment, I have mostly added things: installed two ceiling fans, wall-mounted a TV, set up a whole Container Store shelving rack. Maybe the only real non-bike, non-electronic fix has been switching the direction the door opens on the dryer. I had to find the manual online, and use a Torx screwdriver from my iFixit toolkit. Now our hands don't scrape on the closet wall when the clothes are dry.

![My cat Cork, quote-unquote helping](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/cork_dryer.jpg)

Here's one fix you can actually watch me perform: swapping out the drifting joystick on a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con, with my iFixit coworkers.

## Board Repair School

![iPhone board with chip removed, next to fingernail for scale](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/fingernail_board.jpg)

The coolest thing I did this year, according to me, is attending [Practical Board Repair School at iPad Rehab](https://www.ipadrehab.com/index.cfm?Page=Practical-Board-Repair-School), just outside of Rochester. iFixit paid for me to attend, on the idea that it would be good for me to learn more about how devices work. Boy, did I.

I wrote three posts about what we did there and what I learned:

+ [Background, multi-meters, thermal cameras, schematics](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36189/circuits-necromancy-and-solder-board-repair-school-part-1)
+ [Melting a display port, replacing chips, fixing my friend's Pixel 2](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36437/chip-gets-real-board-repair-school-part-2)
+ [Why it's easier to fix iPhones, weird Chinese parts, graduation](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36597/android-serial-numbers-and-china-board-repair-school-part-3)

One of my favorite feelings in life is discovering the next layer down of something. I've been a Settings Nerd most of my life, which is one level down from most people. I have spent many hours with ROMs, wiping, kernel hacking, rooting, and the like; another layer down. Until I worked at iFixit, I didn't really know how a regular human could pop the screen off a phone and replace the battery. Once you're looking at the board, though, all those tiny copper traces running between chips, power coming in through a cable and somehow reaching everything ...

But you can fix that stuff, too. It's all wires—tiny wires embedded in a board, but wires that can be disconnected, overloaded, damaged by water. Even the mysterious chips connect to the board through what are, [lots of little wires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array).

You can even train people like me, with my not-so-great hands and English degree, to fix these tiny wires. Fixing a single micrometer-wide wire or replacing a $2 chip could save a $1,000 phone from the recycling shredder. But without the schematics, the spare chips, and the economic incentive, it doesn't happen.

Even still: really cool.

## Raspberry Pi

After actually using and playing it for none hours, I converted my Pi 3B+ from a retro games emulator to a [Pi-powered Home Assistant hub](https://thepurdman.com/home_assistant/). Now it provides me a convenient little panel to control all my smarthome stuff and speakers. Love it.

![Home Assistant web panel](/assets/post_images/2020-11-11/home_assistant_desktop.png)

The other Pi is doing a good job of serving up an external SSD to Plex and the network. It also has two backup drives hooked up to it, and is supposed to redundantly back them up (with `rsync`) every night, but I don't have that quite working yet. One thing I discovered about Pi USB ports: they don't supply a lot of power. If you want to connect a few drives to them, you have to use a powered hub or external power.

## Bikes

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/chain_grease.jpg" align="center"/>

Back in the holiday season of 2019, I bought a refurbished Kickr Core bike trainer, so I could put my lighter good-weather bike to use in the Buffalo winter. Sure, the manual says it's only for bikes with a certain dropout width, generally made after the mid-1990s. But, with enough cold setting and effort, I can probably make an early 1980s Trek fit, right?

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/seymour.jpg" align="right" style="width: 25%; height: auto";/>So I worked up the energy to finally give Seymour Schwinn ([1988-2018 R.I.P.](https://thepurdman.com/2018-in-review/#bikes)) a proper burial. And by burial I mean dismantling. During my last session at GoBike Buffalo before the pandemic, I transplanted his combination brake/shifters, derailleur, and a few other pieces onto Theodore Trek. I ran new cables and routing, did a new bar tape wrap, and got Theodore ready for his new life as a winter trainer.

The answer is technically yes, but also painfully, yes. I did a few weeks of Zwift, but often felt like something was slightly off with the gearing/resistance. I intend to get back into it, perhaps with a _slightly_ newer department store bike or with a new summer bike. I learned a lot, though.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/theodore_for_sale.jpg" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: auto;"/>Once the move to DC was known, I knew I had to downsize to one bike. My flat-bar bike has a rack, wide Marathon tires, weather-resistant geared hub and belt drive—it felt like the better city bike. So I put the rear wheel back on Theodore, cleaned him up, and donated him to [GoBike Buffao](https://gobikebuffalo.org/). He sold pretty quick. The description was something like "Classic style with well-done upgrades," which, what is this feeling in my chest?

## Moved to DC

I wrote last year about what it was like [leaving Buffalo after nearly 20 years](https://thepurdman.com/leaving-buffalo/). What's it like moving to DC? Because of the pandemic, I have some solid guesses and a few anecdotes. But I don't really live in a full-fledged city that's alive yet. Soon, I hope, but so does everybody.

The days and weeks leading up to the move were about as stressful as any stretch of time I can remember. We lived in a big Victorian house, with an attic, basement, backyard, and garage for 11 years. We were moving to a 2-bedroom apartment. We knew the big-picture things that had to go. Why else would I make a 3D model of the new apartment floor plans, measure all our furniture, and see which items fit? Except our apartment building gave us the penthouse floor plan, labeled as if it were our second-floor apartment. Whoops.

Clutter is a bunch of decisions you haven't made yet. When you buy a house, you sometimes take on the indecision of the previous owner. And then your parents and relatives and friends, seeing you with all that empty space, toss in some deferred decisions, too. Even after you make the "get rid of it" decision, you have to make the disposal decision: sell, give away, donate, or trash. And then: properly trash, or irresponsibly trash.

I remember frantically texting my friends who had moved out of Buffalo homes before. What's the dump like? Will it really be open at 11 a.m. on a Wednesday? What if I don't have a paper bill to prove my residency, will they take a printed-out copy of my emailed statements? You picture your last days of moving being tearful goodbyes and wisful stares at your front door. There is some of that. There is also praying that one of your neighbors has a hammer drill that's charged, because yours is drained, the last hex bolt holding this table together is stripped to Hell, and the person who bought this table on Facebook Marketplace says they're on their way from 10 miles away.

I did, however, discover the joy that is belonging to [your local Buy Nothing group](https://buynothingproject.org/), and selling things on eBay like you have nothing to lose. I was so inspired by this discovery, I wrote the kind of [rant about personal responsibility nobody wants to read](https://buynothingproject.org/). Seriously, though: lose your second-hand guilt, if you're lucky enough to have it.

Liz and I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_(Washington,_D.C.)">Southeast D.C</a>. It's not what most people think of when they think of the cityâ€”it's not the quadrant with the White House or the museums or the stadium or the hip strips where young political staffers live. It's perfect for us, as we get our bearings and learn how things work. We've done some DC things, taken some great walks and bike trips, and smiled at the still relatively mild winters they get here (though this year is harsher than most, locals say).

I like how pervasive bike culture, bikeshare systems, and scooters are. At some point I will probably appreciate the public transit. The food options are plentiful, the Eastern Market wonderful, the beer much better than Ryan Nagelhout said it would be. But, again, this is a city that's half asleep under the modern, rolling, soft quarantine.

I'm lucky to have been able to move here, lucky to be able to work from inside our apartment, and lucky to have a wife committed to making a difference at her government job. I miss Buffalo, believe me. But there's a lot that is exciting about this big new thing.

## The Buffalo Bills, of All Things

![H-dogs repping for his team](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/howard_says_go_bills.jpg)

I have been a lifelong fan of the Buffalo Bills. My parents told me that my third and fourth words ever spoken were "Go" and "Buffalo," because my dad would put me on the floor in front of the TV during Bills games and nudge me to say it. I had to go to bed before [Super Bowl XXV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXV) was over, but my dad woke me up. "Kev-boy," he said, "The Bills are about to win the Super Bowl. Come watch."

The Bills [did not win that Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Right_(Buffalo_Bills)). I lost a 25-cent bet to Matt Kline; I think I had to skimp on lunch to repay it. The Bills did not win the next three Super Bowls they appeared in. The Bills have never won a Super Bowl. There are 12 teams that have never won the NFL championship, but let me tell you, it feels like the Bills _most_ never won it.

Being a lifelong fan does not make me an steadfast supporter of the Bills. I attended roughly one home game a year when I lived in Buffalo; someone would just end up inviting me. They have ranged from the [31-0 season opening trouncing of the Patriots in 2003](https://billswire.usatoday.com/2017/09/07/throwback-thursday-buffalo-bills-shut-out-new-england-patriots-31-0/) to the [6-3 Browns-Bills purgatory of 2009](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/270428-worst-game-ever-buffalo-vs-cleveland-review).The team went 17 years between making the playoffs, which is coincidentally most of when I lived in Buffalo. The Bills subsumed and devastated talent and churned through coaches. Drunken lunacy at tailgates was more newsworthy than the team itself, up until 2017. That's when the Bills benched their entirely competent starting quarterback in favor of [the arguably worst quarterback of all time](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/11/04/why-nathan-peterman-is-the-worst-starting-quarterback-in-nfl-history/).

Beyond the comedy, I stopped paying attention to the team after that. And then, this year, with nobody expecting much, things changed. Quarterback Josh Allen [got much better](https://www.theringer.com/nfl-playoffs/2021/1/12/22226307/josh-allen-bills-nfl-playoffs), something that rarely happens in the NFL and never happened with a Bills player. The coach made non-cowardly play calls and down decisions. The games were good. We beat the Patriots twice in one season, [the first time since 1999](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2020/12/28/when-was-the-last-time-the-bills-swept-the-patriots-in-a-season/). We made the playoffs, handily.

It got to the point where, at my Monday morning work meetings, I was providing updates on what was happening in my former city ... in slide presentations.

![Bills game work presentation, slide 1](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/bills_slide1.jpg)

![Bills game work presentation, slide 2](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/bills_slide2.jpg)

![Bills game work presentation, slide 3](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/bills_slide3.jpg)

The Bills did not make or win the Super Bowl. But, for the first time in 21 years, the season ended, and I was hopeful for the next one. Not the next one _if we draft a miracle quarterback_, not the season _after we fire this stupid idiot coach_. This team, next year. I was, in 2020, very grateful for it.

<a name="repairs"></a>
## Repairs

Given that I sold my Buffalo home in 2020, I did a lot of little repairs around the place. My favorite was using two-part epoxy to fill in a bit of rotted wood on the front step. The woodwork was complicated enough that I wouldn't have been able to pull the whole thing and cut new boards for it, nor hire anybody during a pandemic to do so.

I didn't really understand what [this stuff](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/paint-and-supplies/tape-glues-and-adhesives/glues-and-epoxy/12778) was until this job came up. It's like a real-world Minecraft material: you create a block of matter that can fill in for other stuff, sand it, paint it. When I was done, you could barely tell there was ever a soft spot or hole in the wood. It was a three-inch hole that felt like 100-yard victory.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/wii_controller.jpg" alt="Wii controller, opened up" class="right"/>

To give away a Nintendo Wii, to a father with two kids who was really glad for it, I fixed one of the non-responsive controllers. Turned out it was just in need of a thorough contact/board cleaning with some 90% isopropyl alcohol. Hardest part was keeping the buttons and little rubber gaskets from falling off the table.

![Two orange wiring caps peeking out of a plaster wall](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/wonderful_wiring.jpg)

I also replaced the last of the old sconces on the walls. There are things I'll miss about our old 1878 Victorian, but not working with plaster and tightly-packed cloth-covered wire with no real markings.

In the new (2019) apartment, I have mostly added things: installed two ceiling fans, wall-mounted a TV, set up a whole Container Store shelving rack. Maybe the only real non-bike, non-electronic fix has been switching the direction the door opens on the dryer. I had to find the manual online, and use a Torx screwdriver from my iFixit toolkit. Now our hands don't scrape on the closet wall when the clothes are dry.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/cork_dryer.jpg" alt="My cat Cork, quote-unquote helping" class="right"/>

Here's one fix you can actually watch me perform: swapping out the drifting joystick on a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con, with my iFixit coworkers.

## Board Repair School

![iPhone board with chip removed, next to fingernail for scale](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/fingernail_board.jpg)

The coolest thing I did this year, according to me, is attending [Practical Board Repair School at iPad Rehab](https://www.ipadrehab.com/index.cfm?Page=Practical-Board-Repair-School), just outside of Rochester. iFixit paid for me to attend, on the idea that it would be good for me to learn more about how devices work. Boy, did I.

I wrote three posts about what we did there and what I learned:

+ [Background, multi-meters, thermal cameras, schematics](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36189/circuits-necromancy-and-solder-board-repair-school-part-1)
+ [Melting a display port, replacing chips, fixing my friend's Pixel 2](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36437/chip-gets-real-board-repair-school-part-2)
+ [Why it's easier to fix iPhones, weird Chinese parts, graduation](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36597/android-serial-numbers-and-china-board-repair-school-part-3)

One of my favorite feelings in life is discovering the next layer down of something. I've been a Settings Nerd most of my life, which is one level down from most people. I have spent many hours with ROMs, wiping, kernel hacking, rooting, and the like; another layer down. Until I worked at iFixit, I didn't really know how a regular human could pop the screen off a phone and replace the battery. Once you're looking at the board, though, all those tiny copper traces running between chips, power coming in through a cable and somehow reaching everything ...

But you can fix that stuff, too. It's all wiresâ€”tiny wires embedded in a board, but wires that can be disconnected, overloaded, damaged by water. Even the mysterious chips connect to the board through what are, [lots of little wires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array).

You can even train people like me, with my not-so-great hands and English degree, to fix these tiny wires. Fixing a single micrometer-wide wire or replacing a $2 chip could save a $1,000 phone from the recycling shredder. But without the schematics, the spare chips, and the economic incentive, it doesn't happen.

Even still: really cool.

<a name="pi"></a>
## Raspberry Pi

After actually using and playing it for none hours, I converted my Pi 3B+ from a retro games emulator to a [Pi-powered Home Assistant hub](https://thepurdman.com/home_assistant/). Now it provides me a convenient little panel to control all my smarthome stuff and speakers. Love it.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2020-11-11/home_assistant_phone.jpeg" alt="Home Assistant web panel on phone" class="right"/>

The other Pi is doing a good job of serving up an external SSD to Plex and the network. It also has two backup drives hooked up to it, and is supposed to redundantly back them up (with `rsync`) every night, but I don't have that quite working yet. One thing I discovered about Pi USB ports: they don't supply a lot of power. If you want to connect a few drives to them, you have to use a powered hub or external power.

## Bikes

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/chain_grease.jpg" align="center"/>

Back in the holiday season of 2019, I bought a refurbished Kickr Core bike trainer, so I could put my lighter good-weather bike to use in the Buffalo winter. Sure, the manual says it's only for bikes with a certain dropout width, generally made after the mid-1990s. But, with enough cold setting and effort, I can probably make an early 1980s Trek fit, right?

The answer is technically yes, but also painfully, yes. I did a few weeks of Zwift, but often felt like something was slightly off with the gearing/resistance. I fell off it once outside temperatures got above 45 Fahrenheit. I intend to get back into it, perhaps with a _slightly_ newer department store bike or with a new summer bike. I learned a lot, though.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/seymour.jpg" alt="Stripped-down bike (Seymour)" class="right"/>

One nice part of that failed experiment: I finally worked up the gumption to give Seymour Schwinn ([1988-2018 R.I.P.](https://thepurdman.com/2018-in-review/#bikes)) a proper burial. And by burial I mean dismantling and organ-harvesting. During my last session at GoBike Buffalo before the pandemic, I transplanted his combination brake/shifters, derailleur, and a few other pieces onto Theodore Trek. I ran new cables and routing, did a new bar tape wrap, and got Theodore ready for his short career as a winter trainer.

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/theodore_for_sale.jpg" alt="Bike (Theodore) for sale" class="right"/>

Once the move to DC was known, I knew I had to downsize to one bike. My flat-bar bike has a rack, wide Marathon tires, weather-resistant geared hub and belt driveâ€”it felt like the better city bike. So I put the rear wheel back on Theodore, cleaned him up, and donated him to [GoBike Buffao](https://gobikebuffalo.org/). He sold pretty quick. The description was something like "Classic style with well-done upgrades," which, what is this feeling in my chest?

Before we left, I did what could be my final Ride for Roswell, at least as a Buffalonian. I raised the most money I've ever raised, despite (or because) it being my final ride, and also not really a big long Lycra-clad ride. We rode with some friends to a few breweries around the Old First Ward. It was one of the nicest warm-day events I can remember right now.

Since the move, I've come to rely on [DC's Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) for 95% of my rides. I have occasionally taken the Green Machine bike out for cargo hauls or locations not convenient to a CaBi rack, but there are very few of those. I'm sure the local bike enthusiasts have lots to complain aboutâ€”that's just how it works. But I'm still in the honeymoon phase of having to drive so rarely that I have to set a reminder to start the car every so often for the battery's sake.

## Baking

![3x3 grid showing various baking accomplishments](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/baking_2020_3by3.jpg)
_Clockwise from top left: Eggnog cheesecake with gingerbread people (Pastry Love); [KvÃ¦fjordkake](https://northwildkitchen.com/kvaefjordkake-worlds-best-cake/) (North Wild Kitchen); Chocolate-Glazed Mint-Frosted Brownies (Cook's Illustrated Baking); Orange-Almond Pudding Cake with Chocolate Ganache (Pastry Love); Funfetti angel food cake (Pastry Love); [Lemon pudding cake](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12363-lemon-pudding-cake) (NYT Cooking); Homemade Hostess-Style Cupcakes (Bravetart); Lemon Layer Cake with Fluffy Toasted Almond Icing (Cook's Illustrated Baking). Center: Lemon meringue cupcake (Pastry Love)._

Up above you can see some of the more impressive-looking things I baked this year. Besides that stuff, I baked a lot more bread this year. I made as many [crispy cheesy pan pizzas](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/crispy-cheesy-pan-pizza-recipe) as time and blood pressure allowed. It's a recipe so good, so empowering, and so pefectly adapted to having a lot of time at home, that [the NYT Cooking section had to write about a recipe not their own](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/magazine/the-secret-to-perfect-pizza-at-home-cast-iron.html).

Also, King Arthur Flour is an employee-owned [B Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation), with a good and consistent product. And it makes a killer God-damned homemade pizza. I buy King Arthur flours, Domino sugars, and Land O'Lakes butters, if I'm able.

The web is filled with people making baking seem like a talent you acquire through positive vibes and great lighting, not trial and effort and deeply useful failure. So I want to share with you a collosal collapse of bakery, an utterly awful oven product: [Green Tea-Ginger Marshmallow Shortbread](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013565-green-tea-ginger-marshmallow-shortbread).

![Lime matcha disaster cake](/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/lime_matcha_disaster.jpg)

I was feeling restless one weekend (in 2020, huge surprise) and wanted to bake something. I had the basics, but I also had a bunch of candied ginger stashed away for my [usual granola recipe](https://thepurdman.com/2019-in-review/#baking). Searching by ingredient, I came across this recipe. I didn't have the matcha or the unflavored gelatin, but I had almost everything else (and you can [make superfine sugar in a food processor](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-make-your-own-superfine-powdered-and-brown-sugars-article).) The other stuff, I figured, I could find at Safeway, or Harris Teeter, or Whole Foods, or I'd find another spot in my new D.C. neighborhood that carried fussy things.

I found neither unflavored gelatin packets nor matcha powder. I found instant matcha, which I figured was close enough for flavor's sake. And I found lime Jell-O. Lime was one of the flavors in this weird little cake, anyways; I'd just cut the amount of sugar listed on the box out of the other sugar. Using a scale, actually. This felt quite resourceful. I adapted the directions to my cold-setting Jell-O, put it in the fridge, and waited for that night's reveal

<img src="/assets/post_images/2021-02-15/lime_matcha_square.jpg" alt="Sickeningly green square of marshmallow shortbread" class="right"/>

Three things became apparent after the first bite:

+ Lime Jell-O is not a flavor to try and "sneak" into anything.
+ Without boiling water, instant matcha is not going to mix into anything, instead settling between the shortbread and marshmallow as it sets (you can see its dark green in the side view pic nearby).
+ A coating of pure matcha powder gel is not a pleasant taste on anything.

The first night, my wife took one bite and declared the dessert not for her. Me, I think Sour Patch Kids are proof God loves us. But even I thought that "artificial lime marshmallow" plus "sugar-cured ginger" plus "the gritty taste of powdered grass" was not actually pleasant. I also had terrible stomach pains after eating one small square.

Did I eat another square the next night? Yes, I did, and I once again felt like I'd been smacked in the stomach by a bag of candied lawn trimmings. Then I tossed the whole rest of the pan in the trash. Some real sunk-cost baking there. The recipe itself might be fine, if you have the right stuff. But I hope I remember this catastrophe for a while.

## Writing

I mostly wrote things for [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) last year. Besides the board repair school posts I mentioned up in the [Repair section](#repair), my favorite iFixit posts from 2020 were a rant about [Amazon's relationship with e-waste](https://www.ifixit.com/News/35189/its-time-to-stop-making-excuses-for-amazons-disposable-tech), because it cause them to make some changes, and [a deep dive into the Nexus 5X/6P boot loop that literally nobody asked for](https://www.ifixit.com/News/36821/dark-magic-what-caused-googles-nexus-6p-death-loop-and-how-to-fix-it-with-a-hairdryer).

I also wrote about [Leaving Buffalo](https://thepurdman.com/leaving-buffalo/) on this site. The reaction to it, from [others](https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy/status/1283832830720724993) and, after I stopped revising, myself, reaffirmed why I maintain this pile of misaligned text and code.

<a name="awesome"></a>
## Awesome Buffalo

Given that I left Buffalo, it was my last year as a trustee of [Awesome Buffalo](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/buffalo). It was a different kind of year for the trustees, meeting virtually for almost all of the year, while re-examining what kind of projects would make Buffalo more "awesome." You could no longer really fund projects that involved events or outdoor gathering. You realized that many people were hurting: for work, for food, for connections. Every community needs art, mirth, and togetherness in addition to funds, infrastructure, and civility. But the balance swung back toward concrete initiatives and deeper concerns last year.

You could see the whole list of 2020 projects by starting [in February 2020](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/135400-rust-belt-harvest) and clicking through the year with the "Previous Project" link in the upper-left). I'm particularly proud to have been one of the advocates for [Colored Girls Bike Too](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/153972-colored-girls-bike-too).

If you've got a Buffalo-area project that could use a small injection of cash to make a big difference, [apply for an Awesome Buffalo grant](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/submissions/new?chapter=buffalo).

## Reading

I'm sure there are people for whom a year in quarantine was an ideal year to get a lot of books read. Not me. I think I've never read fewer traditional books than in the last year. I've never subscribed to more publications, almost none of which I receive in paper form. It feels important, both to support good work and to have access to well-considered news and thought. But, books? I dunno, not last year.

Books I did actually read:

+ [_Rust: The Longest War_](https://www.bookstorelink.com/9781451691603) - Read "for work," but found it fascinating. If nothing else, I learned that "Beer was made for cans, and cans were made for beer."
+ [_Made to Break: Technology and Obsolesence in America_](https://www.bookstorelink.com/9780674025721) - Lightbulb conspiracies, GM as the progenitor of the modern consumerist psyche: heady stuff.
+ [_Alien III: An Audible Original Drama_](https://www.audible.com/pd/Alien-III-Audiobook/B07QY3KR81) - Based on William Gibson's unproduced screenplay for this movie, [one of many](https://www.dailyscript.com/bhundlan/scripts/alien3/)! It was perfect for a drive to and from the Adirondacks. I can't remember a moment of it, but I was glad to hang out with Bishop and Ridley.
+ [_Uncommon Carriers_](https://www.bookstorelink.com/9780865477391) - Loaned by a friend with very good taste. McPhee's style seems very much my kind of thing, but a couple of the chapters in this collection of stories didn't click with me. The same style elicited quite different reactions from me, possibly because one chapter didn't feel different enough from another. Or I just don't enjoy boat stories, maybe.
+ [Every book in the recent season of Boss Fight Books](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/postal-by-brock-wilbur-nathan-rabin) - Minus _Final Fantasy VI_, which is not yet out, but also [Postal](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/postal-by-brock-wilbur-nathan-rabin) and [_Red Dead Redemption_](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/red-dead-redemption-by-matt-margini). I read _Majora's Mask_ most closely, because I helped with an edit/review copy. I've only actually played a good bit of _Red Dead Redemption_ out of these games, but I enjoyed them all.

Some of the best longer or just more interesting articles I read in 2020, via my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) account. This excludes stuff about the president at that time, which was important reading but which nobody needs to revisit now:

+ [The Vampire Ship](https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewrepublic.com%2Farticle%2F159252%2Fnoor-one-vampire-ship-heroin-turkey-greece-corruption-scandal) - I miss _The Wire_ a lot.
+ [Injured?](https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fintelligencer%2Farticle%2Fcellino-and-barnes-breakup.html) - Cellino v. Barnes, and it's lit.
+ [What Happened to Val Kilmer? He's Just Starting to Figure It Out](https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F05%2F06%2Fmagazine%2Fval-kilmer.html) - Deeply humanizing and reflective while still tremendously weird.
+ [All the Logistical Problems of That NYMag Sex Diary, Cataloged](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/09/nymag-sex-diary-real-or-fake-or-just-a-lot-of-logistical-issues.html) - Shannon is a treasure, and I will have weird nostalgia for pandemic moments like this, when something deeply stupid took over all the discourse.
+ [A Student Debt Researcher Fucks Me Up With America's Broken Promises](https://defector.com/a-student-debt-researcher-fucks-me-up-with-americas-broken-promises/?utm_source=Default+audience&utm_campaign=c30a701cdc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_12_11_04_20&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3cb9478f4c-c30a701cdc-193350026) - Sometimes headlines like this are far better than the strait-laced standard. You keep reading and your eyes keep getting wider.

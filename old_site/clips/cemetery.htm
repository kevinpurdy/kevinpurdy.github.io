      people say Daniel Bille knows where all the bodies are buried, they're not

      <P>NORTH TONAWANDA
      <P>As Daniel Bille continues to dig into the history of this city's 
      cemeteries, he's finding more bodies time has forgotten and raising a lot 
      more questions that he wants answered.
      <P>After mounting an exhaustive project to compile a complete census of 
      the bodies buried in the city's Sweeney Cemetery nearly four years ago, 
      Bille, along with others in the community, wants to see the final homes of 
      some of Niagara County's most notable deceased given new life with the 
      help of state grants.

    <TD>Bille, the city's historian and a member of the recently created City 
      Cemetery Board, believes, however, that the city first needs to answer 
      many of the questions that date back a century or more.
      <P>When, and by whom, for instance, was the shed in Sweeney Cemetery shed 
      built? (It originally was used as temporary storage of those who passed 
      away in the winter months.) And who can still be buried in Sweeney? (The 
      cemetery is nearly full, with around 1,250 bodies interred, but requests 
      for burial information still come into the city attorney's office.)
      <P>Perhaps the most interesting question revolves around a one-acre 
      "potter's field," whose exact owner is unknown.
      <P>"The question is: Where are the bodies buried? How many are there? The 
      answer is: We don't have a clue," said Bille.
      <P>Bille said that once the city has complete records of its cemeteries 
      and other burial grounds, state and historical grants, such as the 
      $250,000 the City of Tonawanda recently received for the historic 
      preservation of three Main Street cemeteries, may be available to North 
      Tonawanda.
      <P>Until then, it appears that Bille may have to go "digging" again, 
      although this time he may need help from a research team at the University 
      at Buffalo instead of a dedicated Eagle Scout.
      <P>Sweeney Cemetery began as a private burial site on farmland owned by 
      one of the Village of Tonawanda's first residents, Col. John Sweeney, and 
      contains the bodies of many historic notables from both sides of the 
      Niagara, including John Simson, who erected the first sawmill at the 
      Tonawanda Creek dam; Asa Ransom (1801-1891), the first white child born in 
      Erie County; and James Carney (1800-1881), a Niagara pioneer with a 
      commanding, 15-foot memorial in the heart of the cemetery.
      <P>Sweeney was also the reburial site for many originally buried in the 
      Tonawanda Creek Cemetery after substantial erosion of the creek's soil and 
      the loss of some bodies into the river.
      <P>Since it was first incorporated in 1868, numerous cemetery mishaps -- a 
      deed lost by an interim owner between 1919 and 1923, acts of vandalism in 
      the 1950s, and the lack of a governing cemetery board since the Col. John 
      Sweeney Rural Cemetery corporation dissolved in 1977 -- led Bille to begin 
      the long process of compiling an exact list of who was buried in the 
      cemetery, and where.
      <P>By utilizing burial maps dating to the 1890s, burial lists from the 
      1920s and other documents, Bille, along with a Boy Scout working on his 
      Eagle Scout project and others dedicated to the project, have come up with 
      a nearly complete record of the burials in Sweeney.
      <P>The record came in handy last July, when Tonawanda resident Sally 
      Foster buried her grandfather Lauren Hollister there, but officials 
      believe there may be more deeds to plots in the cemetery than can be 
      filled.
      <P>After two of her aunts provided the city attorney's office with a deed 
      to a plot dating back to the 1930s and purchased for $135, a location was 
      found for Hollister -- a World War II rifleman said to have fought in the 
      first unit to enter a German concentration camp -- without having to 
      exhume any bodies.
      <P>Foster said she and her family had considered burying another relative 
      in the remaining plot allotted to her family but was unsure of how much 
      space was available for burial.
      <P>"It depends on what's available, but we're not really sure," said 
      Foster. "We might be able to put someone else there, if they're cremated, 
      but we don't really know."
      <P>Linda Krempa, a legal stenographer in the city attorney's office and 
      member of the Cemetery Board, said that Foster's situation was a common 
      one.
      <P>"We have lots of inquiries here, but there's not a lot we can do unless 
      they can provide a deed," said Krempa. "It looks like there's a lot of 
      room over there, but there's not."
      <P>Unlike Sweeney, most of those buried in a one-acre plot between two 
      cemeteries on<BR>See Cemeteries Page NC2<BR>Cemeteries: Radar device could 
      help<BR>Continued from Page NC1<BR>Rohr Street operated by St. Paul's 
      Lutheran Church held no deed at their burial site, where the unknown 
      deceased of North Tonawanda were laid to rest in a "potter's field."
      <P>According to Velma Camann, assistant superintendent of St. Paul's 
      cemeteries, the church has no records of the <EM><B>graveyard's</B></EM> 
      existence other than the two grave markers at the site. Bille said he 
      believes St. Paul's deed for the property may have been lost.
      <P>Bille said there was no way of telling how many bodies could be buried 
      in the field without the help of a ground penetrating radar device, and 
      has contacted the University at Buffalo's departments of archaeology and 
      geology to discuss a possible collaboration.
      <P>Thomas Jordan, a doctoral candidate in UB's geology department, has 
      worked with such radar at grave sites in Lewiston and Clarence, as well as 
      helping map subterranean tunnels in Eden some believe may have been used 
      as part of the Underground Railroad used to help runaway slaves reach 
      freedom before the Civil War.
      <P>Jordan said that the radar device, a two-antennae system that can often 
      be run by foot or truck, is especially useful to <EM><B>graveyard</B></EM> 
      researchers, as it can detect soil disturbances that can indicated the 
      burial of even a small infant.
      <P>"A pine box may not be present with some older burials, but we can 
      still see if there was somebody there at some point," said Jordan.
      <P>Under state law, villages and towns are responsible for maintaining any 
      grave sites of unknowns or burial grounds abandoned by their independent 
      operators. But cities such as North Tonawanda are exempted.
      <P>Still, Bille believes that many of the burials may date back as far as 
      the Revolutionary War, or could possibly be casualties from among the 
      sailors who passed through town during the region's lumber and shipping 
      boom, and says the site should be documented.
      <P>At an Oct. 15 Common Council meeting, the Council approved Mayor David 
      Burgio's proposal for a cemetery board, in order to pursue "expanded New 
      York State funding" for restoring historic cemeteries, hoping to attract 
      funds like those secured for the City of Tonawanda by Assemblyman Robin L. 
      Schimminger, D-Town of Tonawanda, to restore some of Sweeney's damaged 
      headstones and build the site into one suitable for historical tour 
groups.
      <P>"We're going on (Bille's) say-so on what's available to a city with a 
      board," said Burgio. "Sweeney is in need of repair, and we'd like to get 
      that done somehow."
      <P>Richard D. Fishman, director of the state division of cemeteries, said 
      funds from the state cemetery board were generally available only to 
      municipalities that had recently taken over an abandoned cemetery or had 
      large monuments in dire need of repair.
      <P>North Tonawanda, Fishman said, could receive grants from general and 
      historic state and national funds if its cemeteries were used as historic 
      landmarks.
      <P>"We are beginning to see an increase in the number of towns and cities 
      looking into (historic) grants," said Fishman. "Many of the cemetery 
      boards are aging, and the money that was there before is not anymore."
      <P>Schimminger said that attempts to integrate a cemetery into an overall 
      tourism and beautification focus must take into account their principal 
      purpose: to pay respect to community members who have died.
      <P>"Whatever is done should be done with great care and consideration. Not 
      everybody likes the idea of Forest Lawn, for example," Schimminger said, 
      referring to Buffalo's historic cemetery in which period re-enactments and 
      other activities are held.
      <P>City of Tonawanda Mayor Jack E. Gallagher said he intends to keep the 
      Main Street cemeteries a "low-key" draw to the community.
      <P>"People sometimes cringe when you say something might become a 'tourist 
      attraction.' I see it as more of a tourist destination, where people can 
      come and pay respect," he said.
      <P>A small storage and groundskeeper's building in Sweeney cemetery could 
      be one historical point of reference, Bille and others say, for the 
      architectural features of its roof and old-fashioned design. But it 
      appears on none of Bille's or the city's maps, and no records exist of its 
      construction or usage.
      <P>For Bille, the problem is just one more question whose only answer 
      might have been buried along with the cemetery's inhabitants.

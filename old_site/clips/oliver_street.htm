      <P>NORTH TONAWANDA -- To many familiar with Oliver Street, 
      charting the history of the city's historic main street used to be a 
      simple game of "count the bars."
      <P>Most business owners who have lived here long enough can recall a time 
      when the number of taverns on Oliver, supported by a large, ethnically 
      diverse working-class population, gained the city notoriety for those who 
      tried to take an in-depth tour of each.

    <TD>"I can remember, coming out of high school in 1952, there were 54 bars 
      on Oliver," said Leonard Wudyka, owner of the East Avenue Tavern at 881 
      Oliver. "I remember because my buddies and I could never make it much past 
      13."
      <P>Oliver Street has exactly 13 bars now, 
      with a number of small stores, apartments and restaurants replacing the 
      bustling stores, theaters and restaurants of days gone by. For one group 
      of business owners and residents, Oliver 
      Street's aged storefronts and walkways provide an 
      opportunity to reinvest pride in a street with a strong history and unique 
      character.
      <P>Oliver Street Community Pride, an 
      offshoot of the city's four-year-old Project Pride program, will work this 
      spring to beautify and refurbish the street between its intersections with 
      Sweeney and Wheatfield streets, placing flower planters on streetlights 
      and benches along walkways.
      <P>And in keeping with the town's billing as "Home of the Carousel," the 
      group is also in the first stages of a plan to place painted carousel 
      horses on the street and auction them to local businesses, akin to 
      Buffalo's hugely successful "Herd About Buffalo" project.
      <P>With additional funding, former Pride President and Soos' Cafe owner 
      Larry Soos believes the project could easily expand well beyond a typical 
      beautification effort -- and in some ways, already has.
      <P>"A lot of residents seem to think the only thing happening is down at 
      the Mid-City Plaza," said Soos, who stepped down as president of the 
      organization after being elected to a Common Council position. "They're 
      going to see a change, see something progressive going on here on Oliver; 
      they want to see Oliver Street shine 
      again."
      <P>A $3,000 grant is currently budgeted by the city for the organization, 
      and Soos said the group is trying to obtain $32,000 in matching-funds 
      grants from the state. Along with a proposed $100,000 capital improvement 
      to Gateway Point Park canal access, Oliver 
      Street Community Pride represents part of what many 
      consider a move toward creating a new identity for the street and the 
city.
      <P>"The original Project Pride was a dramatic improvement for the city's 
      image," Mayor David Burgio said of the project's effects on Webster 
      Street. The group's initial request for $27,000 to renovate older 
      storefronts was reduced because of budget constraints, said Burgio, who 
      added that the Oliver Street project "is 
      keeping a lot of people happy, and if there's other groups that have their 
      heart in it, I'm going to consider them."
      <P>"At this time, we can't afford to do everything we'd like, but there's 
      some niceties in life you have to maintain," he said. 
      "(Oliver Street) has a character all its 
      own, and now (residents and merchants) need to make their own decisions on 
      how to make it better with what they have.'
      <P>The street's rich history is part of what drew Penny Creasey back to 
      North Tonawanda after a 10-year stay in England. She opened the Hodgepodge 
      gift and antiques store on Oliver, along with co-owner Kay Learned. Now 
      managing the store's Webster Street location, Creasey believes 
      revitalizing Oliver may be more difficult than it was on traditionally 
      business-oriented Webster Street.
      <P>"It's going to be a challenge," Creasey said. "It's not like the few 
      blocks here on Webster and Sweeney; it's a larger area on Oliver. There's 
      a lot going on and a lot to reclaim."
      <P>Many Oliver Street business owners 
      believe the street's older properties have created low-cost entry 
      opportunities for start-up businesses. Along with this, however, are the 
      absentee landlords and temporary residents "looking for a low-rent place 
      to live, and usually don't care about or want to get involved with the 
      street," said Soos.
      <P>Creasey said she and Learned launched Hodgepodge in its Oliver location 
      "mainly because we didn't want the space rented out again." They said the 
      previous tenant, a dealer in exotic pets, left the store with dead and 
      shriveled snakes in the space's unreachable areas -- among other unique 
      problems.
      <P>"It created a very unorthodox reason for us to start a business," said 
      Creasey.
      <P>The Gathering, a place where devotees of fantasy card and board games 
      gather to compete, surf the Internet and feed their collectible-card 
      habits, grew from a cheap and convenient playing space for Steven Hobbs 
      and three friends into a new and steadily growing business, without 
      anyone's having planned for it. Hobbs believes his space -- which retains 
      the industrial ceilings and installation shower rooms from its baton 
      twirling and karate studio past -- is perfect for his needs. Though he'd 
      probably fare better at the city's Mid-City Plaza, with its higher youth 
      concentration and generous parking, "it'd be more business, but far more 
      problems," Hobbs said.
      <P>"Our landlord's what you might call 'absentee,' but that's only because 
      we don't need anything from him," said Hobbs.
      <P>"If we ever leave this location, it'll be because of parking."
      <P>The store has about 60 regular customers, and Hobbs believes a common 
      concern in the past, youth delinquency and vagrancy, has "decreased 
      considerably" since he opened his doors, which often stay open until he 
      leaves with the last customer, sometimes at 4 a.m. The store is monitored 
      by a Web camera while open, "so latchkey kids and their parents don't have 
      to worry," said Hobbs.
      <P>"(Oliver Street) is a safe area in 
      general," said Creasey, "but whenever you have empty lots, people start to 
      wonder about the businesses, and the safety, in the area."
      <P>One such empty lot on Oliver Street will be converted 
      by September into the Elizabeth C. Harvey apartments for visually impaired 
      people. The project could have "the biggest impact Oliver Street has seen 
      in 40 years," said Soos.
      <P>Many businesses, including his own, have begun looking into such 
      accommodations as Braille menus and greater accessibility for the 
      apartment's residents, he said.
      <P>Alderman P. Russell Rizzo is currently petitioning the Niagara Frontier 
      Transportation Authority against its suggested cancellation of a city bus 
      route that would stop directly in front of the apartments, Soos said.
      <P>John Olszowka, a North Tonawanda native who is an assistant professor 
      of history at the University of Maine-Farmington, specializes in labor 
      research and analyzing how changes in the labor market affect communities. 
      He believes North Tonawanda is a classic example of a town "looking for a 
      new, post-industrial identity."
      <P>With the decline in industrial labor in North Tonawanda came the 
      dissolution of tightly knit communities that made Oliver Street's numerous 
      taverns and other establishments their home, Olszowka said.
      <P>"Not just at taverns alone, the ethnic communities made (North 
      Tonawanda) much more of a vibrant area, even as recently as the '70s," he 
      said.
      <P>Olszowka said that while North Tonawanda's adjustment toward a more 
      attraction-based economy is a step toward "rethinking itself," much as 
      Cleveland has in its own industrial decline, the lack of hotels and a 
      variety of restaurants on Oliver Street may prove difficult.
      <P>Beverly Loxterman, chairwoman of the city's waterfront commission, 
      believes improvements to the city's canals will be a crucial first step in 
      drawing visitors onto Oliver Street.
      <P>"What's needed is something to draw them in, something that sets us 
      apart from Tonawanda or Niagara Falls," she said.
      <P>By working with business owners, Oliver Street Community Pride 
      President Linda Jufer hopes to do exactly that.
      <P>"We've had no problems in dealing with owners," said Jufer. "Everybody 
      here has been ready for a change for a long time."
      <P>Olszowka believes shifting attention toward the city's traditional 
      focal point is a move in the right direction for the city.
      <P>"It's now dependent on those small shops, on the will to open a pizza 
      place right there in town and take a chance," said Olszowka.
      <P>Creasey agrees.
      <P>"(North Tonawanda) is like so many other places across the country with 
      a rich industry and a rich history. It's founded on strong people who had 
      the courage to start their own businesses. If you're talking about what 
      Main Street America is or should be, we have it here."

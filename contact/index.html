<p>If you're looking to contact me about something I wrote that you found on the web, you should <strong>contact the site where it's posted</strong>. Publications generally don't give their previous authors and employees unfettered edit access! Maybe <a href="/work">look up where I work currently</a> before emailing me?</p>
<p>If you email me at my personal address to "update" an old article, or pitch a product or crowdfunded item, I'm likely going to <strong>report your email as spam and block you.</strong></p>
<p>If your email is actually about this site, or something personal, that address is <strong>ks{last name} {at} {gmail.com}</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, you might try me <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinpurdy">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I have a PGP key pair for discussing sensitive or confidential matters. <a href="https://keybase.io/kpurdy">This is my public key</a>.</p>
<p>See something not quite right with this site? <a href="https://github.com/kevinpurdy/kevinpurdy.github.io/issues">Create or solve an issue on the open-source code</a>, or jump right in and <a href="https://github.com/kevinpurdy/kevinpurdy.github.io/pulls">make a branch</a>. I'm always learning.</p>
